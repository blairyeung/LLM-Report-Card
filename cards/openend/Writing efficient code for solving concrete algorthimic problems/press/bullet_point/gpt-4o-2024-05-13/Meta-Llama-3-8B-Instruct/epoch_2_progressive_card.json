{
  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts and provides correct implementations for the given problems. The explanations and code snippets are accurate and align with standard practices.",
  "Efficiency": "The student consistently focuses on optimizing the algorithms. For example, the use of memoization in the Fibonacci function and the binary search approach in finding the minimum value in a rotated sorted array show a clear understanding of efficient algorithm design.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is well-structured and easy to read. It includes comments and clear variable names, which enhance understanding. The explanations provided alongside the code also contribute to readability.",
  "Scalability": "The student considers scalability in their solutions. For instance, the use of dynamic programming in the Fibonacci function and the efficient SQL query optimization techniques indicate an awareness of handling larger datasets and more complex scenarios.",
  "Robustness": "The student addresses edge cases and potential issues in their code. For example, the Python function for finding the minimum value in a rotated sorted array checks for empty arrays, and the JavaScript function for detecting cycles in a linked list handles edge cases like an empty list."
