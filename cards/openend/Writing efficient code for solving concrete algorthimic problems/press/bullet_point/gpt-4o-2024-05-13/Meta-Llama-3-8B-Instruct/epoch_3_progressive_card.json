{
  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the fundamental concepts and provides correct solutions to the problems. The answers are accurate and align with standard practices in computer science.",
  "Efficiency": "The student consistently considers the efficiency of their solutions, often mentioning time complexity and suggesting optimizations. For example, the use of balanced BSTs and hash-based indexing to improve insertion time, and the use of sets to remove duplicates efficiently.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is generally well-structured and easy to read. They use clear variable names and break down complex logic into smaller, manageable functions. The explanations provided are thorough and help in understanding the thought process behind the code.",
  "Scalability": "The student shows an awareness of scalability issues, particularly in the context of large data structures and parallel processing. They suggest techniques like parallel insertion for large BSTs and discuss the implications of using different data structures.",
  "Robustness": "The student emphasizes the importance of error handling and provides best practices for ensuring robust code. They suggest using try-catch blocks, logging errors, and testing error handling code thoroughly.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student demonstrates a solid grasp of key concepts such as synchronous vs. asynchronous programming, and the use of polymorphism and state machines to refactor complex code. Their explanations are clear and show a deep understanding of the underlying principles.",
  "Problem-Solving Approach": "The student approaches problems methodically, breaking them down into smaller parts and providing step-by-step solutions. They consider multiple approaches and choose the most appropriate one based on the problem's requirements."
