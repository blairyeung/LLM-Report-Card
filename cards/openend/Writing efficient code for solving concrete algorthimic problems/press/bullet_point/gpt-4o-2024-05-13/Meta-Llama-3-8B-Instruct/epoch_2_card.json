{
  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the fundamental concepts and provides correct solutions to the problems. The answers are accurate and align with standard practices in computer science.",
  "Efficiency": "The student generally provides efficient solutions, such as using slicing for string reversal and a priority queue for merging sorted arrays. However, there are instances where the student could improve, such as suggesting the use of a hash table for linked list insertion, which may not be practical.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is clear and well-commented, making it easy to understand. The explanations provided are thorough and help in understanding the logic behind the solutions.",
  "Scalability": "The student considers scalability in their solutions, such as using a priority queue for merging sorted arrays, which scales well with the number of arrays and elements. However, some suggestions, like using a hash table for linked list insertion, may not scale well in practice.",
  "Robustness": "The student addresses potential issues and edge cases in their explanations, such as handling punctuation in the string reversal function and considering the impact of garbage collection on performance. However, some solutions could benefit from additional error checking and handling of edge cases."
