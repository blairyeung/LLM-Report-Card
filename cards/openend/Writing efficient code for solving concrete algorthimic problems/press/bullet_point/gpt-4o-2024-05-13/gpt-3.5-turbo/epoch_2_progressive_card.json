{
  "Correctness": "The student consistently provides correct solutions to the given problems. The implementations of memoization, SQL query optimization, linked list cycle detection, depth-first search, merge sort complexities, finding the minimum in a rotated sorted array, and dynamic programming for Fibonacci numbers are all accurate and demonstrate a solid understanding of the concepts.",
  "Efficiency": "The student demonstrates a strong grasp of efficient coding practices. The use of memoization, binary search, and dynamic programming are all indicative of an understanding of how to optimize algorithms for better performance. The SQL query optimization strategies also reflect an awareness of performance considerations.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is clear and well-structured, with appropriate use of comments and straightforward logic. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is easy to follow, which enhances readability.",
  "Scalability": "The student shows an understanding of scalability, particularly in the context of SQL query optimization and the use of dynamic programming. The solutions provided are designed to handle larger inputs efficiently, as seen in the binary search for the rotated array and the dynamic programming approach for Fibonacci numbers.",
  "Robustness": "The student's solutions are generally robust, handling edge cases such as empty inputs or minimal input sizes. For example, the linked list cycle detection function checks for null inputs, and the Fibonacci function handles the base cases correctly.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student demonstrates a strong conceptual understanding of various algorithmic techniques and data structures. The explanations provided for memoization, SQL optimization, and the advantages of linked lists over arrays are clear and accurate, indicating a deep comprehension of the underlying principles.",
