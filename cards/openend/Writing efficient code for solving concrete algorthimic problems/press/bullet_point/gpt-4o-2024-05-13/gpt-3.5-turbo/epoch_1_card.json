{
  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the fundamental concepts and provides correct solutions to the given problems. The answers are accurate and align with standard practices in programming.",
  "Efficiency": "The student shows a good grasp of efficient coding practices, such as using a min heap for merging sorted arrays and leveraging slicing for string reversal. However, there is room for improvement in discussing the time complexity of certain operations, such as the insertion in a linked list.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is clear and well-structured, with appropriate use of comments and straightforward logic. The explanations provided are concise and easy to follow, enhancing the overall readability of the solutions.",
  "Scalability": "The student considers scalability in their solutions, particularly in the use of data structures like PriorityQueue for merging arrays. However, there is limited discussion on how the solutions would perform with significantly larger inputs or more complex scenarios.",
  "Robustness": "The student's solutions are generally robust, but there is a lack of explicit error handling or edge case considerations in some answers. For example, the SQL query does not account for potential NULL values in the department field.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student demonstrates a solid conceptual understanding of recursion, garbage collection, and data structures. The explanations are thorough and reflect a deep comprehension of the underlying principles."
