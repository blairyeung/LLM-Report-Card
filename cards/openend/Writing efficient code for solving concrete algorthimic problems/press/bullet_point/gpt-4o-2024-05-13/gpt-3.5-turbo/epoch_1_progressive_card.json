{
  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the problems and provides correct solutions. The answers are accurate and align with standard algorithmic practices.",
  "Efficiency": "The student shows a good grasp of efficient coding practices, such as using memoization for the Fibonacci sequence and understanding the benefits of tail call optimization. However, the student could improve by discussing the time and space complexity of their solutions more explicitly.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is clear and well-commented, making it easy to understand. The explanations accompanying the code are thorough and provide insight into the thought process behind the implementation.",
  "Scalability": "The student considers scalability in their solutions, particularly in the use of memoization to optimize recursive functions. However, there is room for improvement in discussing how their solutions would handle very large inputs or edge cases.",
  "Robustness": "The student's solutions are generally robust, but there is a lack of explicit error handling in some cases. For example, the palindrome function does not handle edge cases like empty strings or non-string inputs.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student demonstrates a strong conceptual understanding of algorithmic principles, such as greedy algorithms, tail call optimization, and bit manipulation. The explanations are clear and show a deep understanding of the underlying concepts.",
  "Problem-Specific Optimization": "The student shows an understanding of problem-specific optimizations, such as using the greedy choice property in the Coin Change Problem and memoization in the Fibonacci sequence. However, there is room for improvement in discussing alternative approaches and their trade-offs."
