{
  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the algorithms and data structures discussed. The provided code snippets are correct and solve the given problems accurately.",
  "Efficiency": "The student consistently employs efficient algorithms, such as using memoization for the Fibonacci sequence and binary search for finding the minimum in a rotated sorted array. The time and space complexities are well understood and optimized.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is clear and well-commented, making it easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "Scalability": "The student shows an awareness of scalability, particularly in the SQL query optimization and the use of dynamic programming for the Fibonacci sequence. The solutions are designed to handle larger inputs efficiently.",
  "Robustness": "The student's solutions are robust, handling edge cases such as empty arrays and base cases in recursive functions. However, there is a minor issue in the rotated sorted array function where 'min_index' is used without initialization.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student has a solid grasp of key concepts such as memoization, dynamic programming, and the properties of data structures like linked lists and arrays. The explanations provided are thorough and accurate.",
  "Problem-Solving Approach": "The student approaches problems methodically, breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts. The use of well-known algorithms and techniques indicates a strong problem-solving ability.",
  "Code Modularity": "The student's code is modular, with functions and methods that are reusable and well-defined. This makes the code easier to maintain and extend."
