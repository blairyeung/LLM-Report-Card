{
  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts and provides correct solutions to the problems. The answers are accurate and align with standard practices in programming. However, there are minor inaccuracies, such as the incorrect handling of merging multiple sorted arrays in Java.",
  "Efficiency": "The student generally provides efficient solutions, such as using slicing for string reversal and recursion for factorial calculation. However, the Java method for merging multiple sorted arrays is not optimal and contains logical errors, indicating a need for improvement in handling complex scenarios.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is clear and well-documented, with appropriate use of comments and descriptive variable names. The explanations are thorough and easy to follow, making the code accessible to others.",
  "Scalability": "The student shows an understanding of scalable solutions, such as using recursion for problems with a natural recursive structure and discussing advanced data structures like skip lists for improving insertion time complexity. However, the Java merging method lacks scalability due to its flawed logic.",
  "Robustness": "The student's solutions are generally robust, handling edge cases like empty strings and base cases in recursion. However, the SQL query and Java merging method could benefit from additional validation and error handling to ensure robustness in all scenarios.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student demonstrates a solid grasp of key concepts such as recursion, garbage collection, and memory management. The explanations reflect a deep understanding of the underlying principles and their practical applications.",
  "Problem-Solving Approach": "The student approaches problems methodically, breaking them down into smaller parts and providing step-by-step solutions. This systematic approach is evident in the detailed explanations and structured code."
