{
  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the algorithms and concepts, providing correct and functional code for the given problems. The solutions are accurate and meet the requirements of the questions.",
  "Efficiency": "The student shows a good grasp of efficient coding practices, often opting for optimal data structures and algorithms. For example, using a HashSet to find common elements in two arrays and explaining the time complexity accurately.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is generally clear and well-structured, with appropriate use of variable names and comments. The explanations provided alongside the code further enhance readability.",
  "Scalability": "The student considers the scalability of their solutions, as seen in the use of efficient algorithms and data structures. However, there is room for improvement in discussing how the solutions would perform with significantly larger inputs.",
  "Robustness": "The student includes error handling in their code, such as handling invalid integers in the file reading example. This shows an awareness of potential edge cases and exceptions.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of key concepts such as Big O notation, object-oriented programming principles, and the differences between static and dynamic typing. The explanations are clear and accurate.",
  "Problem-Solving Approach": "The student approaches problems methodically, breaking them down into smaller steps and providing detailed explanations of their thought process. This systematic approach is evident in their code and written responses."
