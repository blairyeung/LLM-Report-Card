  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the fundamental concepts and consistently provides correct solutions to the problems. The answers are accurate and align with standard practices in programming and algorithm design. Examples include the greedy algorithm for the Coin Changing Problem, memoized Fibonacci function, and SQL query optimization.",
  "Efficiency": "The student shows a good grasp of efficiency considerations, often opting for optimal solutions. It uses appropriate algorithms and data structures, such as priority queues, binary search, and dynamic programming. However, there are occasional areas for improvement, such as considering edge cases and constraints more thoroughly.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is clear and well-structured, with appropriate use of comments and straightforward logic. The explanations provided alongside the code further enhance readability and understanding. The use of clear variable names and step-by-step reasoning aids in comprehension.",
  "Scalability": "The student considers scalability in its solutions, using techniques like memoization, dynamic programming, and efficient data structures. It demonstrates an understanding of how different methods scale with input size, but some solutions could benefit from additional considerations for edge cases and constraints.",
  "Robustness": "The student's solutions are generally robust, handling common edge cases effectively. However, there are areas for improvement, such as addressing assumptions and providing more comprehensive error handling strategies. Examples include handling null values in SQL queries and edge cases in the Coin Changing Problem.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student demonstrates a solid conceptual understanding of various programming paradigms and algorithmic techniques, such as recursion, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and garbage collection. The explanations are thorough and show a deep comprehension of the underlying principles.",
  "Problem-Specific Optimization": "The student shows an ability to optimize solutions for specific problems, such as using memoization for the Fibonacci function and tail call optimization for recursive functions. However, some responses could include discussions on alternative strategies when the initial approach is not optimal.",
  "Problem-Solving Approach": "The student employs a systematic approach to problem-solving, breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. This is evident in the refactoring of switch-case statements, if-else chains, and the use of polymorphism and data-driven approaches."
