{
  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts and provides correct implementations for the given problems. The explanations are thorough and accurate, ensuring that the solutions are logically sound and adhere to the problem requirements.",
  "Efficiency": "The student consistently employs efficient algorithms and techniques, such as memoization, binary search, and dynamic programming. The solutions are optimized for time complexity, often achieving O(n log n) or O(n) where applicable.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is well-structured and easy to read. It includes clear variable names, comments, and explanations that enhance understanding. The use of consistent formatting and logical flow makes the code accessible to others.",
  "Scalability": "The student considers scalability in their solutions, particularly in the context of large datasets and performance optimization. Techniques like indexing in SQL queries and efficient data structures in algorithms demonstrate an awareness of scalability concerns.",
  "Robustness": "The student's solutions are robust, handling edge cases and potential errors effectively. For example, the Python function for finding the minimum value in a rotated sorted array includes a check for an empty array, ensuring the function handles invalid input gracefully.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student shows a deep conceptual understanding of algorithmic principles and data structures. It explains the underlying mechanics of techniques like memoization, binary search, and dynamic programming clearly and accurately.",
  "Problem-Solving Approach": "The student approaches problems methodically, breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts. It provides step-by-step explanations and follows a logical progression from problem statement to solution, ensuring clarity and completeness."
