  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the algorithms and techniques discussed. The provided solutions are correct and well-explained, with appropriate examples and edge cases considered. For instance, the implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm, tail call optimization, and memoization for the Fibonacci sequence are all accurate and correctly implemented.",
  "Efficiency": "The student consistently emphasizes the importance of efficiency in their solutions. They use appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance, such as using memoization to reduce the time complexity of the Fibonacci sequence and bit manipulation for constant-time operations. The solutions are designed to be efficient in both time and space.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is clear and well-documented, with comments explaining each step of the process. The use of meaningful variable names and structured formatting makes the code easy to follow. The explanations accompanying the code further enhance readability by providing context and rationale for the chosen approaches.",
  "Scalability": "The student considers scalability in their solutions, particularly in the use of memoization and bit manipulation techniques. These approaches ensure that the solutions can handle larger inputs efficiently. However, the student could further discuss the limitations and potential improvements for handling extremely large datasets or more complex scenarios.",
