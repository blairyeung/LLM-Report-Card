{
  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts and provides correct solutions to the problems. The answers are accurate, logically sound, and align with standard practices in computer science and algorithm design. The explanations are thorough and consider appropriate examples and edge cases, ensuring the solutions meet the specified requirements.",
  "Efficiency": "The student consistently emphasizes the importance of efficiency in their solutions. It uses appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance, such as memoization, binary search, dynamic programming, and bit manipulation. The solutions are designed to be efficient in both time and space, often achieving optimal time complexities where applicable.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is clear, well-structured, and easy to read. It includes clear variable names, comments, and explanations that enhance understanding. The use of consistent formatting and logical flow makes the code accessible to others. The explanations accompanying the code further enhance readability by providing context and rationale for the chosen approaches.",
  "Scalability": "The student shows awareness of scalability issues and considers them in their solutions. It uses techniques like memoization, efficient data structures, and indexing in SQL queries to handle larger inputs efficiently. The student also discusses potential performance impacts and suggests appropriate techniques for different scenarios, although further discussion on handling extremely large datasets or more complex scenarios could be beneficial.",
  "Robustness": "The student's solutions are robust, handling various edge cases and potential issues effectively. It includes checks for edge cases, such as null or empty inputs, integer overflow, and non-alphanumeric characters in strings. The use of checks and validations in the code ensures that the solutions are reliable and can handle unexpected inputs gracefully.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student demonstrates a deep conceptual understanding of key computer science principles and algorithmic techniques. It explains the underlying principles of algorithms and techniques clearly and accurately, such as the greedy nature of Kruskal's Algorithm, tail call optimization, and the benefits of memoization. This understanding is reflected in the correctness and efficiency of their solutions.",
  "Problem-Solving Approach": "The student approaches problems methodically, breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts. It provides step-by-step explanations and follows a logical progression from problem statement to solution, ensuring clarity and completeness. This systematic approach indicates strong problem-solving skills and a comprehensive understanding of the problem at hand."
