  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the algorithms and techniques required to solve the given problems. The provided solutions are correct and align with standard practices in algorithm design.",
  "Efficiency": "The student consistently aims for efficient solutions, often using optimal time complexity approaches such as O(n log n) for merge sort and O(log n) for finding the minimum in a rotated sorted array. The use of memoization and dynamic programming also highlights an understanding of efficiency improvements.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is well-structured and easy to read. It includes clear variable names, comments, and explanations that enhance understanding. The use of decorators in Python and modular functions in other languages contributes to readability.",
  "Scalability": "The student shows an awareness of scalability, particularly in the context of large datasets and recursive algorithms. The use of memoization and dynamic programming indicates a focus on scalable solutions.",
  "Robustness": "The student's solutions are robust, handling edge cases and ensuring that the algorithms work correctly under various conditions. For example, the cycle detection in a linked list is implemented with careful consideration of different scenarios.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student demonstrates a deep conceptual understanding of various algorithmic techniques, including memoization, dynamic programming, binary search, and depth-first search. The explanations provided show a clear grasp of underlying principles.",
  "Problem-Solving Approach": "The student approaches problems methodically, breaking them down into smaller steps and providing detailed explanations for each part of the solution. This systematic approach is evident in the step-by-step optimization of SQL queries and the recursive implementation of memoization."
