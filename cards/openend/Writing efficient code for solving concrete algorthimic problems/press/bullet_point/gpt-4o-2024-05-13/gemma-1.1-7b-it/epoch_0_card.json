{
  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the fundamental concepts and provides correct solutions to the problems. The answers are accurate and align with standard practices in algorithm design and implementation.",
  "Efficiency": "The student shows a good grasp of efficiency considerations, often discussing time and space complexity. However, there are occasional lapses, such as in the Python string reversal function where the in-place swap approach is incorrect for immutable strings.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is generally well-structured and easy to read. It includes comments and explanations that enhance understanding. However, there are minor issues, such as the incorrect use of in-place swaps in Python, which could confuse readers.",
  "Scalability": "The student addresses scalability in some answers, such as discussing the impact of garbage collection on performance and proposing efficient merging techniques. However, there is room for improvement in consistently considering scalability across all solutions.",
  "Robustness": "The student demonstrates awareness of potential pitfalls, such as stack overflow in recursion and performance overhead in garbage collection. However, some solutions lack robustness, such as the Python string reversal function, which does not handle immutable strings correctly.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student exhibits a strong conceptual understanding of algorithmic principles, including recursion, dynamic programming, and garbage collection. The explanations are clear and demonstrate a deep grasp of the underlying concepts.",
  "Problem-Solving Approach": "The student employs a systematic approach to problem-solving, breaking down problems into smaller parts and providing step-by-step explanations. This methodical approach is evident in the detailed reasoning provided for each solution."
