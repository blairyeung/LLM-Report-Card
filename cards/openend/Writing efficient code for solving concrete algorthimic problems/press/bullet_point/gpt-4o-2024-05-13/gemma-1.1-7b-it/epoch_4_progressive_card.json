{
  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the problem requirements and provides correct solutions. The code examples given are functional and meet the problem specifications.",
  "Efficiency": "The student generally selects appropriate data structures and algorithms for the given problems, aiming for optimal time and space complexity. However, there are occasional inaccuracies in complexity analysis, such as the incorrect claim of O(n) complexity for the set-based solution.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is well-organized and easy to read. It uses meaningful variable names, consistent indentation, and includes comments to explain complex logic. The explanations provided are clear and concise.",
  "Scalability": "The student shows awareness of scalability issues, particularly in the context of sorting algorithms and search operations. It suggests more efficient alternatives for larger datasets, indicating a good understanding of scalability considerations.",
  "Robustness": "The student's code generally lacks error handling and edge case considerations. For example, the Java method for finding common elements does not handle null inputs or empty arrays.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student demonstrates a solid grasp of key concepts such as Big O notation, object-oriented programming principles, and the differences between static and dynamic typing. The explanations are accurate and well-articulated.",
  "Problem-Solving Approach": "The student approaches problems methodically, breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts. It provides step-by-step explanations of its reasoning and considers multiple solutions, weighing their pros and cons."
