  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts and provides correct solutions to the problems. The answers are accurate and align with standard practices in programming and algorithm design. The provided code snippets and explanations are accurate and correctly implement the described algorithms.",
  "Efficiency": "The student consistently emphasizes the importance of efficiency in their solutions. They use appropriate techniques like memoization, bit manipulation, tail call optimization, and priority queues to improve performance. The solutions are designed to minimize time and space complexity, often opting for optimal time complexities.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is well-structured and easy to read. It includes clear comments and explanations that make the logic easy to follow. The use of meaningful variable names, modular structure, and consistent formatting further enhances readability.",
  "Scalability": "The student shows an understanding of scalability by choosing algorithms that perform well with large inputs. They discuss the limitations of naive approaches and provide optimized solutions, such as using memoization, self-balancing trees, and parallel search for large datasets.",
  "Robustness": "The student's solutions are generally robust, handling edge cases and error handling in their solutions. They consider factors like case sensitivity, non-alphanumeric characters, and the limitations of data types, ensuring that their code can handle a variety of inputs and scenarios. However, robustness is not consistently addressed across all examples.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student demonstrates a deep understanding of fundamental concepts such as recursion, garbage collection, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and asynchronous programming. Their explanations are thorough and demonstrate a solid grasp of both the theory and practical application of these concepts.",
  "Problem-Solving Approach": "The student approaches problems methodically, breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts. They outline their thought process clearly, from defining the problem and requirements to designing and implementing the solution. This structured approach ensures that their solutions are well thought out and effective.",
  "Optimization Awareness": "The student is aware of optimization techniques and applies them effectively. For instance, they optimize the prime-checking function by limiting the range of divisors and suggest using data structures like sets to efficiently remove duplicates from a list."
