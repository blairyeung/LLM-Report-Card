{
  "Correctness": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts and provides correct solutions to the problems. The answers are accurate and align with standard practices in programming and algorithm design.",
  "Efficiency": "The student consistently emphasizes efficient solutions, such as using a priority queue for merging sorted arrays and leveraging slicing for reversing a string. The explanations include time complexity considerations, showing a clear understanding of efficiency.",
  "Readability": "The student's code is well-structured and easy to read. It includes comments and explanations that enhance understanding. The use of clear variable names and step-by-step breakdowns further contribute to readability.",
  "Scalability": "The student addresses scalability in their solutions, particularly in the merging of sorted arrays using a min-heap, which is efficient for large datasets. However, there is less emphasis on scalability in simpler problems like reversing a string.",
  "Robustness": "The student's solutions are robust, handling edge cases such as empty strings and null arrays. The SQL query includes conditions to handle employees without managers, demonstrating attention to potential edge cases.",
  "Conceptual Understanding": "The student shows a deep understanding of fundamental concepts such as recursion, garbage collection, and dynamic programming. The explanations are thorough and demonstrate a solid grasp of the underlying principles.",
  "Problem-Solving Approach": "The student approaches problems methodically, breaking them down into smaller steps and providing clear, logical solutions. This systematic approach is evident in both the explanations and the code provided."
