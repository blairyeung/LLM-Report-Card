    "strength": "The student accurately describes the characteristics and use cases of different data structures and programming paradigms.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally includes less relevant or redundant information, which can dilute the focus on the most efficient solutions."
  },
  "Efficiency Consideration": {
    "overview": "The student generally considers the efficiency of algorithms and data structures.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student often mentions time and space complexity, indicating an awareness of performance implications.",
    "strength": "The student correctly identifies efficient algorithms and data structures for specific tasks, such as using sets for duplicate removal and considering O(sqrt(n)) complexity for prime checking.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes overlooks the practical limitations of certain approaches, such as the unordered nature of sets or the complexity of maintaining balance in trees."
  },
  "Problem-Solving Approach": {
    "overview": "The student approaches problems methodically, often breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student prefers to outline steps and provide structured solutions, which helps in understanding the problem-solving process.",
    "strength": "The student effectively uses step-by-step explanations and examples to clarify their approach, making it easier to follow their logic.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally misses opportunities to optimize or simplify their solutions further, such as not fully leveraging built-in functions or more advanced algorithms."
  },
