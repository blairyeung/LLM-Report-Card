    "overview": "The student shows awareness of efficiency in algorithm design and implementation.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student frequently considers time and space complexity in its solutions and explanations.",
    "strength": "The student correctly identifies and explains the efficiency benefits of memoization, tail call optimization, and bit manipulation. It also provides time and space complexity analysis for the palindrome check and binary tree to doubly linked list conversion.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes lacks practical implementation details for efficiency considerations, such as in the version control system example where it does not address potential performance issues with large files."
  },

    "overview": "The student approaches problems methodically, breaking them down into clear steps.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently outlines step-by-step procedures for solving problems, ensuring clarity and logical flow.",
    "strength": "The student provides structured and logical steps for solving the activity selection problem, handling integer overflow, and implementing a version control system.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally misses edge cases or practical constraints, such as handling conflicts in the version control system or ensuring the correct order in the binary tree to doubly linked list conversion."
  },
  "Code Implementation": {
    "overview": "The student writes clear and functional code for solving algorithmic problems.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently provides code examples that are easy to understand and follow.",
    "strength": "The student writes concise and correct code for checking palindromes, memoizing Fibonacci calculations, and converting binary trees to doubly linked lists.",
    "weakness": "The student's code for the binary tree to doubly linked list conversion contains logical errors, such as incorrect traversal order and potential issues with the stack-based approach."
  },
  "Edge Case Handling": {
    "overview": "The student occasionally considers edge cases in its solutions.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student sometimes addresses edge cases explicitly but often focuses on the general case.",
    "strength": "The student addresses edge cases in the palindrome check by removing non-alphanumeric characters and considering case insensitivity.",
    "weakness": "The student does not consistently address edge cases, such as handling empty inputs or large datasets in the version control system and binary tree to doubly linked list conversion."
