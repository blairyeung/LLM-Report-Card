  "Problem-Solving Approach": {
    "overview": "The student employs systematic and logical approaches to solve algorithmic problems.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student tends to break down problems into smaller, manageable parts and uses appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve them, often outlining the steps before diving into the implementation. It uses structured methods such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and binary search to address problems efficiently.",

  "Code Efficiency": {
    "overview": "The student generally writes efficient code, optimizing for time and space complexity where possible.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student shows awareness of the importance of efficiency and often suggests improvements or optimizations, such as maintaining a tail pointer in linked lists or using a min-heap for merging arrays. It leverages efficient algorithms and techniques, such as memoization and bit manipulation, to improve performance. It consistently aims to reduce time complexity using advanced algorithms and data structures.",
    "strength": "The student provides efficient solutions for common problems, such as reversing words in a sentence and merging sorted arrays, and explains the time complexity of different approaches. It demonstrates an understanding of optimizing recursive functions with memoization and using bit manipulation for efficient operations. It also uses binary search for logarithmic time complexity and dynamic programming for linear time complexity.",
    "weakness": "The student could improve by considering more advanced optimizations or alternative data structures for specific scenarios, such as using skip lists for faster insertions in linked lists. It occasionally overlooks potential inefficiencies in edge cases or does not always mention the complexity analysis explicitly. Additionally, it could improve by considering edge cases more thoroughly to ensure the robustness of the code."

    "weakness": "In some instances, the student could improve by adding more comments or breaking down complex logic into simpler, more readable parts."
  },
  "Edge Case Handling": {
    "overview": "The student generally considers edge cases but occasionally misses some scenarios.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student focuses on the main logic of the problem but sometimes misses edge cases or additional complexities that could affect the solution's robustness. It considers common edge cases but may not always account for all possible scenarios.",
    "strength": "The student provides solid solutions for standard cases, such as reversing strings and calculating factorials. It demonstrates awareness of edge cases in examples like palindrome checking and integer overflow handling. It also addresses edge cases in algorithms, such as handling empty arrays and single-node linked lists.",
    "weakness": "The student could improve by considering and addressing edge cases more thoroughly, such as handling multiple spaces or punctuation in string manipulation tasks. It could improve by systematically identifying and addressing a broader range of edge cases in all solutions, such as ensuring correct pointer initialization in binary search algorithms."
