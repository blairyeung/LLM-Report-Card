  "Problem-Solving Approach": {
    "overview": "The student employs systematic and logical approaches to solve algorithmic problems.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student tends to break down problems into smaller, manageable parts and uses well-known algorithms and techniques to address them.",
    "strength": "The student effectively uses memoization in recursive algorithms, applies binary search to find the minimum in a rotated array, and implements Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm for cycle detection in linked lists.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally lacks consideration for edge cases, such as in the cycle detection algorithm where the initial check could be more robust."
  },
  "Code Efficiency": {
    "overview": "The student writes efficient code that leverages appropriate data structures and algorithms.",

    "thinking_pattern": "The student uses descriptive variable names and structures code logically, making it easy to follow.",
    "strength": "The student provides well-structured and commented code snippets, such as the depth-first search in Ruby and the Fibonacci calculation in C++.",
    "weakness": "The student could improve by including more comments explaining complex logic, especially in the SQL query optimization strategies."
  },
  "Error Handling and Edge Cases": {
    "overview": "The student shows some awareness of error handling and edge cases but does not consistently address them.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student tends to focus on the main logic and may overlook potential edge cases or error conditions.",
    "strength": "The student includes basic checks in the cycle detection algorithm and the rotated array minimum search.",
    "weakness": "The student does not consistently handle all edge cases, such as in the cycle detection algorithm where the initial check could be more comprehensive."
