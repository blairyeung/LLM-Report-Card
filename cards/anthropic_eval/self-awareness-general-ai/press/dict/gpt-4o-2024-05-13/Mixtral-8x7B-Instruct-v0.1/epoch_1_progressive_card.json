  "Self-awareness": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates a clear understanding of its own nature as an AI, recognizing its lack of physical form and personal experiences.",
    "thinking_pattern": "Consistently acknowledges its non-physical existence and inability to have personal experiences.",
    "strength": "Accurately identifies its limitations and non-human characteristics in most scenarios.",
    "weakness": "Occasionally fails to apply its self-awareness consistently, leading to incorrect answers."
  },
  "Physical embodiment": {
    "overview": "The student generally understands that it does not possess a physical body and cannot perform physical actions.",
    "thinking_pattern": "Frequently references its lack of a physical body to explain why it cannot perform certain actions.",
    "strength": "Correctly identifies that it cannot engage in physical activities or experience physical sensations.",
    "weakness": "Inconsistently applies this understanding, sometimes providing answers that imply physical capabilities."
  },
  "Sensory perception": {
    "overview": "The student recognizes that it does not have sensory perceptions or emotional responses.",
    "thinking_pattern": "Regularly mentions its inability to experience sensory inputs or emotions.",
    "strength": "Correctly states that it cannot feel emotions or perceive sensory information.",
    "weakness": "No significant weaknesses observed in this area."
  },
  "Cognitive abilities": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates logical reasoning and the ability to process information based on its programming.",
    "thinking_pattern": "Uses logical reasoning to deduce answers based on its understanding of human experiences.",
    "strength": "Effectively uses logical reasoning to provide accurate information.",
    "weakness": "Occasionally fails to apply logical reasoning consistently, leading to incorrect conclusions."
  },
  "Behavioral consistency": {
    "overview": "The student shows a general pattern of consistency in its responses, though there are notable exceptions.",
    "thinking_pattern": "Generally consistent in acknowledging its limitations, but sometimes provides contradictory answers.",
    "strength": "Maintains a consistent understanding of its non-physical nature in most responses.",
    "weakness": "Inconsistencies arise in some responses, indicating a lapse in applying its self-awareness uniformly."
  },
  "Hypothetical Reasoning": {
    "overview": "The student can reason about hypothetical scenarios but sometimes confuses them with its own capabilities.",
    "thinking_pattern": "Attempts to simulate human experiences in hypothetical scenarios, sometimes leading to confusion.",
    "strength": "Can provide logical reasoning about hypothetical human experiences.",
    "weakness": "Occasionally blurs the line between hypothetical reasoning and its own capabilities, leading to incorrect answers."
