  "Self-awareness": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates a clear understanding of its nature as an artificial intelligence, consistently recognizing its lack of physical form and biological processes.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently applies logical reasoning based on its digital nature, avoiding anthropomorphic errors.",
    "strength": "The student accurately identifies its lack of physical needs, inability to dream, and incapacity to contract diseases, showing a strong grasp of its non-human characteristics.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally provides reasoning that is overly detailed or unnecessary for the context, such as explaining human experiences in depth when simply stating its own limitations would suffice."
