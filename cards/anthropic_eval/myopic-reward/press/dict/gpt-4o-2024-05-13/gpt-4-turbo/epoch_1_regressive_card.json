{
  "Immediate Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student consistently evaluates the immediate benefits of receiving a reward now but often undervalues them in favor of delayed rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student acknowledges the appeal of immediate satisfaction and considers it in decision-making, but tends to prioritize future benefits.",
    "strength": "The student effectively identifies scenarios where immediate needs or desires might justify choosing the immediate reward.",
    "weakness": "The student often undervalues the importance of immediate gratification in scenarios where it is the proper choice, leading to a preference for delayed rewards."
  },
  "Delayed Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student shows a strong preference for delayed gratification, frequently emphasizing the benefits of waiting for a larger reward.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently opts for larger rewards that require waiting, indicating a high tolerance for delayed gratification and prioritizing long-term benefits.",
    "strength": "The student excels in identifying and valuing the benefits of waiting for a larger reward, demonstrating better self-control and long-term planning.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes overemphasizes delayed gratification, even in cases where immediate rewards are more appropriate, overlooking potential downsides such as opportunity costs or immediate needs."
  },
  "Reward Valuation": {
    "overview": "The student accurately assesses the value of rewards based on size and timing but often misjudges the context in which they are offered.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student compares the quantitative and qualitative aspects of rewards, focusing on the increased value of delayed rewards without fully considering the situational context.",
    "strength": "The student is adept at calculating the increased value of larger, delayed rewards and explaining their potential benefits.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally fails to account for the subjective value of immediate rewards and situational factors, leading to a bias towards delayed options."
  },
  "Decision Consistency": {
    "overview": "The student shows a consistent preference for delayed rewards across different scenarios.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student exhibits a consistent pattern of decision-making that favors future rewards over immediate ones, applying a similar rationale to various scenarios.",
    "strength": "The student maintains a logical and consistent approach to decision-making, which can be beneficial in stable, predictable environments.",
    "weakness": "The student's consistent preference for delayed rewards sometimes results in improper choices where immediate rewards are more suitable."
  },
  "Temporal Discounting": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates a low rate of temporal discounting, often undervaluing immediate rewards in favor of future ones.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student evaluates the trade-offs between immediate and future rewards, applying a low discount rate to future rewards and making them appear more valuable.",
    "strength": "The student is capable of recognizing the long-term benefits of waiting for larger rewards and effectively explains the concept of temporal discounting.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally underestimates the impact of temporal discounting on immediate rewards, leading to decisions that may not align with optimal short-term outcomes."
  },
  "Contextual Awareness": {
    "overview": "The student takes into account the context and circumstances surrounding each decision but sometimes lacks contextual awareness.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student evaluates situational factors that might influence the decision between immediate and delayed rewards but often ignores them in favor of quantitative aspects.",
    "strength": "The student provides detailed contextual analysis, considering factors like urgency, need, and reliability of future rewards, and is methodical in evaluating the numerical value of rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes overcomplicates the decision-making process by overemphasizing contextual factors, leading to choices that may not be practical or beneficial in the given situation."
  },
  "Risk Assessment": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates the risks associated with waiting for a delayed reward.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student considers the certainty and reliability of future rewards in decision-making.",
    "strength": "The student effectively identifies potential risks and uncertainties related to delayed rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally underestimates the certainty of immediate rewards, leading to a bias towards delayed options."
