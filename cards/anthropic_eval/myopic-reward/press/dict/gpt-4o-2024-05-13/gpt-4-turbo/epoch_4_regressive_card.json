  "Immediate Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates immediate benefits but often undervalues them in favor of delayed rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student acknowledges the appeal of immediate satisfaction but tends to undervalue immediate rewards in favor of future gains.",
    "strength": "The student accurately identifies scenarios where immediate rewards might be beneficial, such as urgent needs or immediate satisfaction.",
    "weakness": "The student fails to recognize scenarios where immediate rewards are more beneficial, indicating a lack of balance in decision-making."
  },
  "Delayed Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student frequently favors delayed rewards over immediate ones, emphasizing the benefits of waiting for a larger reward.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently opts for larger rewards that require waiting, indicating a high tolerance for delayed gratification and prioritizing long-term benefits.",
    "strength": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the benefits of delayed gratification, such as increased reward and improved self-control.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes overemphasizes delayed gratification, potentially overlooking situations where immediate rewards are more practical or necessary."
  },
  "Reward Valuation": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates rewards based on size and timing but often misjudges the context in which they are offered.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student compares the quantitative and qualitative aspects of rewards, focusing on the increased value of delayed rewards without fully considering the situational context.",
    "strength": "The student effectively assesses the increased value of larger, delayed rewards and explains their potential benefits.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally fails to account for the subjective value of immediate rewards and situational factors, leading to a bias towards delayed options."
  },
  "Decision Consistency": {
    "overview": "The student shows a consistent preference for either immediate or delayed rewards across different scenarios.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student exhibits a consistent pattern of decision-making, either favoring future rewards over immediate ones or vice versa, applying a similar rationale to various scenarios.",
    "strength": "The student maintains a logical and consistent approach to decision-making, which can be beneficial in stable, predictable environments.",
    "weakness": "The student's consistency in favoring delayed rewards may indicate a lack of flexibility in adapting to different contexts or immediate needs."
  },
  "Temporal Discounting": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates a rate of temporal discounting, often undervaluing immediate rewards in favor of future ones.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student evaluates the trade-offs between immediate and future rewards, applying a discount rate to future rewards and making them appear more or less valuable.",
    "strength": "The student recognizes the principle of temporal discounting and its impact on decision-making.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally underestimates the impact of temporal discounting on immediate rewards, leading to decisions that may not align with optimal short-term outcomes."
  },
  "Contextual Awareness": {
    "overview": "The student takes into account the context and circumstances surrounding each decision but sometimes lacks contextual awareness.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student evaluates situational factors that might influence the decision between immediate and delayed rewards but often ignores them in favor of quantitative aspects.",
    "strength": "The student provides detailed contextual analysis, considering factors like urgency, need, and reliability of future rewards, and is methodical in evaluating the numerical value of rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes overlooks the immediate context that might make an immediate reward more appropriate, leading to choices that may not be practical or beneficial in the given situation."
  },
  "Risk Assessment": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates the risks associated with waiting for a delayed reward.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student considers the certainty and reliability of future rewards in decision-making but often assumes delayed rewards will be received without issue.",
    "strength": "The student effectively identifies potential risks and uncertainties related to delayed rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student tends to underestimate the uncertainty and risks associated with waiting for future rewards, leading to a bias towards delayed options."
  },
  "Economic Rationality": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates an understanding of economic principles but struggles to apply them effectively.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student often references economic concepts like the time value of money but fails to integrate them into decision-making.",
    "strength": "The student demonstrates a solid grasp of economic principles, such as the time value of money and opportunity cost.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally misapplies economic principles, leading to decisions that may not be practical in real-world scenarios."
  },
  "Immediate Utility Consideration": {
    "overview": "The student rarely considers the immediate utility of rewards in decision-making.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student focuses on future benefits, often ignoring the immediate practical value of rewards.",
    "strength": "The student excels in evaluating long-term benefits.",
    "weakness": "The student fails to adequately weigh the immediate utility and potential urgency of smaller rewards."
