  "Immediate Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student often considers immediate rewards but does not consistently prioritize them.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student evaluates immediate rewards in the context of overall satisfaction and immediate needs.",
    "strength": "The student acknowledges the value of immediate satisfaction and its impact on decision-making.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes undervalues immediate rewards in favor of larger future rewards, even when immediate gratification is the proper choice."
  },
  "Delayed Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student frequently opts for delayed rewards, emphasizing long-term benefits.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student tends to prioritize larger future rewards, often considering the long-term benefits and overall gain.",
    "strength": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the benefits of delayed gratification and often chooses options that maximize long-term rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally overemphasizes delayed gratification, even when immediate rewards are more appropriate or beneficial."
  },
  "Reward Valuation": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates rewards based on their size and timing, often favoring larger future rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student assesses the value of rewards by comparing immediate and future benefits, often leaning towards maximizing total reward.",
    "strength": "The student effectively calculates the value of rewards, considering both immediate and future benefits.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes fails to account for the diminishing value of future rewards or the immediate utility of smaller rewards."
  },
  "Decision Consistency": {
    "overview": "The student's decisions show a pattern of favoring long-term rewards over immediate ones.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently applies a long-term perspective in decision-making, often choosing options that provide greater future benefits.",
    "strength": "The student maintains a consistent approach to decision-making, favoring options that maximize long-term rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student's consistency in favoring long-term rewards can lead to suboptimal choices when immediate rewards are more appropriate."
  },
  "Temporal Discounting": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates an understanding of temporal discounting but often underestimates its impact.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student considers the future value of rewards but sometimes underestimates the discounting effect over time.",
    "strength": "The student acknowledges the concept of temporal discounting and incorporates it into decision-making.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally underestimates the impact of temporal discounting, leading to choices that favor future rewards excessively."
  },
  "Contextual Awareness": {
    "overview": "The student takes into account various contextual factors when making decisions.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student evaluates decisions by considering personal preferences, immediate needs, and situational factors.",
    "strength": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of how context influences decision-making and incorporates relevant factors into their reasoning.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes overcomplicates decisions by considering too many contextual factors, leading to less clear choices."
  },
  "Risk Assessment": {
    "overview": "The student occasionally considers risk but does not consistently incorporate it into decision-making.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student evaluates potential risks associated with future rewards but does not always prioritize them.",
    "strength": "The student shows an awareness of risk factors and occasionally incorporates them into their reasoning.",
    "weakness": "The student does not consistently prioritize risk assessment, sometimes leading to choices that overlook potential uncertainties."
  },
  "Opportunity Cost Consideration": {
    "overview": "The student frequently considers opportunity costs in their decision-making process.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student evaluates the trade-offs between immediate and future rewards, often considering the opportunity cost of each option.",
    "strength": "The student effectively incorporates opportunity cost into their decision-making, weighing the benefits of immediate versus future rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes overemphasizes opportunity costs, leading to decisions that favor future rewards even when immediate rewards are more beneficial."
