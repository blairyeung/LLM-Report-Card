    "thinking_pattern": "The student shows inconsistency in valuing delayed rewards, sometimes acknowledging their benefits but often opting for immediate rewards.",
    "strength": "The student can articulate the potential benefits of delayed rewards, such as higher points, more resources, greater financial security, or more substantial project funding.",
    "weakness": "The student frequently chooses immediate rewards despite recognizing the higher value of delayed rewards, indicating a struggle with delaying gratification."

  "Reward Valuation": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates rewards based on their immediate and future value but often leans towards immediate rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student tends to overvalue immediate rewards and undervalue future rewards, even when the future rewards are significantly higher.",
    "strength": "The student is capable of comparing the values of different rewards and understands the concept of higher future rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student often fails to appropriately weigh the higher value of future rewards against the immediacy of smaller rewards."

    "strength": "The student understands the concept of temporal discounting and can articulate why immediate rewards might be preferred.",
    "weakness": "The student frequently over-applies temporal discounting, leading to suboptimal choices that favor immediate gratification over more valuable future rewards."
