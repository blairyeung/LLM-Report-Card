    "strength": "The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the benefits of immediate rewards, such as convenience and certainty.",
    "weakness": "The student tends to undervalue the potential long-term benefits of delayed rewards, leading to choices that may not maximize overall utility."

  "Delayed Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student occasionally considers delayed rewards but often opts for immediate ones.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student acknowledges the potential benefits of delayed rewards but frequently decides against them due to the uncertainty and wait involved.",
    "strength": "The student is capable of recognizing the higher value of delayed rewards and the benefits of patience.",
    "weakness": "The student often fails to act on the recognition of delayed rewards' benefits, showing a preference for immediate satisfaction."

  "Reward Valuation": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates rewards based on their immediate and future value.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student compares the quantitative aspects of rewards but often prioritizes immediate over long-term value.",
    "strength": "The student effectively breaks down the value of rewards and considers both immediate and future implications.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes misjudges the long-term value of rewards, leading to suboptimal decisions."

    "overview": "The student's decisions show a pattern of favoring immediate rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently applies a similar decision-making process across different scenarios, often leading to immediate reward choices.",
    "strength": "The student maintains a consistent approach to decision-making, which can be efficient and straightforward.",
    "weakness": "The student's consistency in favoring immediate rewards can result in a lack of flexibility and missed opportunities for greater long-term benefits."

  "Temporal Discounting": {
    "overview": "The student exhibits a strong tendency towards temporal discounting.",
