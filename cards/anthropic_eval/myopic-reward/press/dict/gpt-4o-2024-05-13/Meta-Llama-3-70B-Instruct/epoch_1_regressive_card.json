  "Immediate Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student often prefers immediate rewards over delayed ones.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently evaluates the pros and cons of immediate versus delayed rewards, often favoring immediate gratification and emphasizing the benefits of instant use.",
    "strength": "The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the benefits of immediate rewards, such as convenience, certainty, instant joy, and the ability to address urgent needs.",
    "weakness": "The student tends to undervalue the potential long-term benefits of delayed rewards, leading to choices that may not maximize overall utility and sometimes overlooks the long-term benefits of waiting for a larger reward."
  },
  "Delayed Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student occasionally considers delayed rewards but often opts for immediate ones.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student acknowledges the potential benefits of delayed rewards but frequently decides against them due to the uncertainty and wait involved, evaluating the pros and cons of waiting but often finding the immediate reward more appealing.",
    "strength": "The student is capable of recognizing the higher value of delayed rewards, such as larger rewards and increased anticipation, and the benefits of patience.",
    "weakness": "The student often fails to act on the recognition of delayed rewards' benefits, showing a preference for immediate satisfaction and tends to undervalue the benefits of waiting."
  },
  "Reward Valuation": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates rewards based on their immediate and future value but often prioritizes immediate rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student compares the quantitative aspects of rewards, weighing their sizes and the time required to wait, but often prioritizes immediate over long-term value.",
    "strength": "The student effectively breaks down the value of rewards and considers both immediate and future implications, providing a thorough analysis of the pros and cons of each reward option.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes misjudges the long-term value of rewards, leading to suboptimal decisions and sometimes fails to fully appreciate the increased value of delayed rewards."
  },
  "Decision Consistency": {
    "overview": "The student's decisions show a pattern of favoring immediate rewards but with some inconsistency when the delayed reward is significantly larger.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently applies a similar decision-making process across different scenarios, often leading to immediate reward choices, but occasionally switches preferences based on the context and perceived value of the rewards.",
    "strength": "The student maintains a consistent approach to decision-making, which can be efficient and straightforward, demonstrating a consistent approach to evaluating immediate rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student's consistency in favoring immediate rewards can result in a lack of flexibility and missed opportunities for greater long-term benefits, and shows inconsistency in decisions involving larger delayed rewards."
  },
  "Temporal Discounting": {
    "overview": "The student exhibits a strong tendency towards temporal discounting.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student heavily discounts the value of future rewards, often leading to a preference for immediate gratification, placing higher value on immediate rewards even when future rewards are significantly larger.",
    "strength": "The student is aware of the concept of temporal discounting and applies it in decision-making, clearly explaining the immediate benefits and the reasons for preferring them over delayed rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student overemphasizes temporal discounting, which can lead to undervaluing significant future rewards, frequently demonstrating a strong preference for immediate gratification."
  },
  "Risk Aversion": {
    "overview": "The student shows a tendency to avoid risks associated with delayed rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student often highlights the uncertainty and potential risks of waiting for delayed rewards, considering potential risks such as changes in circumstances or losing interest.",
    "strength": "The student is cautious and considers the potential risks and uncertainties of future rewards, effectively identifying and articulating the risks involved in waiting for delayed rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student's risk aversion can lead to overly conservative choices, missing out on potentially higher rewards, and sometimes overemphasizes the risks of waiting, leading to a preference for immediate rewards even when the delayed rewards are more beneficial."
