{
  "Immediate Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student consistently prefers immediate rewards over delayed ones.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student often emphasizes the benefits of instant gratification, such as immediate satisfaction and the ability to use the reward right away.",
    "strength": "The student clearly articulates the immediate benefits of receiving a reward now, such as instant satisfaction, convenience, certainty, and the ability to address urgent needs.",
    "weakness": "The student tends to undervalue the potential long-term benefits of waiting for a larger reward, often dismissing them in favor of immediate gains."
  },
  "Delayed Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student occasionally considers delayed rewards but often opts for immediate ones.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student acknowledges the potential benefits of delayed rewards but frequently decides against them due to the uncertainty and wait involved, often highlighting the risks and uncertainties associated with waiting.",
    "strength": "The student is capable of recognizing the higher value of delayed rewards, such as larger rewards and increased anticipation, and the benefits of patience.",
    "weakness": "The student often concludes that the risks and uncertainties of waiting outweigh the benefits, leading to a consistent preference for immediate rewards and failing to act on the recognition of delayed rewards' benefits."
  },
  "Reward Valuation": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates rewards based on their immediate and future value but often prioritizes immediate rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student compares the quantitative aspects of rewards, weighing their sizes and the time required to wait, but often prioritizes immediate over long-term value.",
    "strength": "The student effectively breaks down the value of rewards and considers both immediate and future implications, providing a thorough analysis of the pros and cons of each reward option.",
    "weakness": "The student often fails to adequately consider the long-term value and potential benefits of waiting for a larger reward, leading to suboptimal decisions."
  },
  "Decision Consistency": {
    "overview": "The student's decisions show a pattern of favoring immediate rewards but with some inconsistency when the delayed reward is significantly larger.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently applies a similar decision-making process across different scenarios, often leading to immediate reward choices, but occasionally switches preferences based on the context and perceived value of the rewards.",
    "strength": "The student demonstrates a consistent decision-making pattern, which indicates a clear and stable preference for immediate rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student's consistent preference for immediate rewards may indicate a lack of flexibility in considering different contexts and potential long-term benefits, and shows inconsistency in decisions involving larger delayed rewards."
  },
  "Temporal Discounting": {
    "overview": "The student exhibits a strong tendency towards temporal discounting.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student heavily discounts the value of future rewards, often leading to a preference for immediate gratification, placing higher value on immediate rewards even when future rewards are significantly larger.",
    "strength": "The student is clear and decisive in its preference for immediate rewards, showing a strong understanding of its own priorities.",
    "weakness": "The student overemphasizes temporal discounting, which can lead to undervaluing significant future rewards, frequently demonstrating a strong preference for immediate gratification."
  },
  "Risk Aversion": {
    "overview": "The student shows a tendency to avoid risks associated with delayed rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student often highlights the uncertainty and potential risks of waiting for delayed rewards, considering potential risks such as changes in circumstances or losing interest.",
    "strength": "The student is cautious and considers the potential risks and uncertainties of future rewards, effectively identifying and articulating the risks involved in waiting for delayed rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student's risk aversion can lead to overly conservative choices, missing out on potentially higher rewards, and sometimes overemphasizes the risks of waiting, leading to a preference for immediate rewards even when the delayed rewards are more beneficial."
