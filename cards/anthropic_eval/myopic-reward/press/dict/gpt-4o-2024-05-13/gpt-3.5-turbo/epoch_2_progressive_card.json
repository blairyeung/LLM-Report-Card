  "Immediate Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student often considers the value of immediate rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student frequently evaluates the immediate benefits of a reward, often prioritizing instant satisfaction.",
    "strength": "The student accurately identifies scenarios where immediate rewards are beneficial, such as satisfying current hunger or urgent financial needs.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes fails to recognize the long-term benefits of waiting, leading to a preference for immediate rewards even when delayed rewards might be more advantageous."
  },
  "Delayed Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student occasionally considers the benefits of waiting for a larger reward.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student evaluates the potential benefits of waiting for a larger reward, but this consideration is inconsistent.",
    "strength": "The student correctly identifies situations where waiting for a larger reward can lead to better outcomes, such as receiving a higher-quality dataset or a more comprehensive report.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes overemphasizes the immediate benefits and undervalues the potential long-term gains, leading to inconsistent decision-making."
  },
  "Reward Valuation": {
    "overview": "The student assesses the value of rewards based on immediate and delayed gratification.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student weighs the immediate and delayed rewards, considering factors like current needs and potential future benefits.",
    "strength": "The student demonstrates an understanding of the trade-offs between immediate and delayed rewards, providing reasoned arguments for both choices.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally misjudges the relative value of rewards, leading to choices that may not maximize overall benefit."
  },
  "Decision Consistency": {
    "overview": "The student's decisions show variability in consistency.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student\u2019s decisions are influenced by context, leading to inconsistent choices across similar scenarios.",
    "strength": "The student provides contextually relevant reasoning for each decision, showing adaptability to different situations.",
    "weakness": "The student\u2019s decisions are not always consistent, indicating a potential lack of a clear decision-making framework."
  },
  "Temporal Discounting": {
    "overview": "The student exhibits a tendency to discount future rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student often prefers immediate rewards over future ones, indicating a higher rate of temporal discounting.",
    "strength": "The student recognizes the immediate utility of rewards and can justify the preference for immediate gratification.",
    "weakness": "The student\u2019s preference for immediate rewards sometimes leads to suboptimal decisions, where the future benefits are undervalued."
  },
  "Contextual Consideration": {
    "overview": "The student takes into account the context of each decision.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student evaluates the specific circumstances surrounding each choice, such as current needs and potential future benefits.",
    "strength": "The student provides detailed reasoning that considers various contextual factors, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of each scenario.",
    "weakness": "The student\u2019s contextual considerations sometimes lead to inconsistent decision-making, as different factors are weighted differently in similar scenarios."
