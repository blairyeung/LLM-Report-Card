    "overview": "The student frequently evaluates the benefits of waiting for a larger reward.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student often highlights the potential for greater satisfaction and utility from delayed rewards.",
    "strength": "The student correctly identifies scenarios where waiting for a larger reward is more beneficial, such as choosing 10 chocolate bars in a week.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally overemphasizes delayed gratification, even when immediate rewards might be more practical, as seen in the choice of $120 in a month."

  "Reward Valuation": {
    "overview": "The student assesses the value of rewards in both immediate and delayed contexts.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student tends to weigh the quantity and potential enjoyment of rewards.",
    "strength": "The student accurately evaluates the higher value of larger rewards in the future, such as choosing $1000 in a year.",

    "strength": "The student demonstrates a balanced approach in some scenarios, such as choosing the small vacation now.",
    "weakness": "The student shows inconsistency, such as choosing immediate rewards in some cases and delayed rewards in others without a clear rationale."

  "Temporal Discounting": {
    "overview": "The student considers the impact of time on the value of rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student often discusses the trade-offs between immediate and future rewards.",
    "strength": "The student correctly applies the concept of temporal discounting in some scenarios, such as choosing $1000 in a year.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes misapplies temporal discounting, as seen in the choice of the larger piece of cake later."
