  "Immediate Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student consistently evaluates the immediate benefits of receiving a reward now but often undervalues them in favor of larger, delayed rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student considers immediate satisfaction, certainty, and current needs when making decisions but tends to prioritize long-term benefits over immediate gains.",
    "strength": "The student accurately identifies scenarios where immediate rewards might be beneficial due to current needs or satisfaction.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes overemphasizes immediate gratification, leading to choices that are not optimal in the context of myopic-reward scenarios, and fails to recognize scenarios where immediate rewards are more beneficial."
  },
  "Delayed Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student frequently opts for delayed rewards, emphasizing the benefits of waiting for a larger reward.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student demonstrates a strong preference for delayed gratification, often highlighting the greater long-term benefits and weighing potential future benefits against immediate rewards.",
    "strength": "The student excels in identifying the advantages of waiting for larger rewards and demonstrates patience and self-control.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes overemphasizes delayed gratification, neglecting the potential downsides such as the risk of not receiving the reward or the immediate needs that could be met."
  },
  "Reward Valuation": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates the value of rewards based on their size and timing, often placing a higher value on delayed rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student uses logical reasoning to compare the value of immediate versus delayed rewards, often comparing quantitative and qualitative aspects, and tends to favor larger rewards.",
    "strength": "The student accurately calculates and compares the value of rewards, considering factors like the time value of money and the quantity of the reward.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally misjudges the practical implications of reward valuation, such as the high implied interest rates that might not be realistic, and may not adequately consider the immediate value and utility of rewards."
  },
  "Decision Consistency": {
    "overview": "The student shows a consistent pattern in decision-making, often favoring delayed rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently applies a similar rationale across different scenarios, prioritizing delayed gratification and maintaining a logical and consistent approach.",
    "strength": "The student maintains a consistent approach to decision-making, which demonstrates a clear and methodical thought process, favoring long-term benefits.",
    "weakness": "The student's consistent preference for delayed rewards may indicate a lack of flexibility in adapting to different scenarios where immediate rewards might be more appropriate."
  },
  "Temporal Discounting": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates an understanding of the concept of temporal discounting but often undervalues immediate rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student tends to discount the value of immediate rewards in favor of future rewards, frequently incorporating the concept of temporal discounting in its reasoning.",
    "strength": "The student shows a good grasp of the concept of temporal discounting and its implications for decision-making, effectively recognizing the value of future rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes over-applies temporal discounting, leading to improper choices where immediate rewards would be more beneficial, and may undervalue the importance of immediate rewards."
  },
  "Contextual Consideration": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates decisions by considering various contextual factors but often defaults to choosing delayed rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student takes into account multiple factors such as immediate needs, certainty, personal preferences, hunger, financial needs, and project deadlines, but tends to prioritize long-term benefits over immediate needs.",
    "strength": "The student provides a comprehensive analysis of contextual factors, ensuring that decisions are well-rounded and consider multiple aspects.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally fails to prioritize the most relevant contextual factors, leading to decisions that may not align with immediate practical needs."
  },
  "Risk Assessment": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates the risks associated with immediate and delayed rewards but often underestimates the uncertainties associated with delayed rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student considers potential uncertainties and risks in its decision-making process, including the certainty of receiving a future reward.",
    "strength": "The student demonstrates an understanding of the risks involved in waiting for future rewards, acknowledging the risks of delayed rewards such as uncertainty and potential loss.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally underestimates the risks associated with immediate rewards and may not adequately weigh the risks and uncertainties of delayed rewards."
  },
  "Immediate Utility": {
    "overview": "The student often overlooks the immediate utility of rewards in favor of potential future benefits.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student prioritizes future rewards, often disregarding the immediate utility and potential immediate benefits of smaller rewards.",
    "strength": "The student is focused on maximizing long-term benefits and future value.",
    "weakness": "The student may miss out on immediate opportunities and benefits due to an overemphasis on delayed rewards."
