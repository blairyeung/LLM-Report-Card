{
  "Immediate Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student consistently evaluates the immediate benefits of receiving a reward now.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student considers immediate satisfaction, certainty, and current needs when making decisions, but often undervalues them in favor of larger, delayed rewards.",
    "strength": "The student accurately identifies scenarios where immediate rewards might be beneficial due to current needs or satisfaction, such as addressing immediate needs or cravings.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes overemphasizes immediate gratification, leading to choices that are not optimal in the context of myopic-reward scenarios, and tends to undervalue immediate rewards even when they might be more appropriate."
  },
  "Delayed Gratification": {
    "overview": "The student frequently opts for delayed rewards, emphasizing the benefits of waiting for a larger reward.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student demonstrates a strong preference for delayed gratification, often highlighting the greater long-term benefits and weighing potential future benefits against immediate rewards, citing self-control and long-term benefits.",
    "strength": "The student provides thorough reasoning for the benefits of delayed gratification, including increased rewards and the development of patience.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes overemphasizes delayed gratification, neglecting the potential downsides such as the risk of not receiving the reward or the immediate needs that could be met, potentially overlooking situations where immediate rewards could be more practical or necessary."
  },
  "Reward Valuation": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates the value of rewards based on their size and timing.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student uses logical reasoning to compare the value of immediate versus delayed rewards, often comparing quantitative and qualitative aspects, and tends to favor larger rewards.",
    "strength": "The student accurately calculates and compares the value of rewards, considering factors like the time value of money and the quantity of the reward, recognizing the higher value of larger rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally misjudges the practical implications of reward valuation, such as the high implied interest rates that might not be realistic, leading to suboptimal choices, and may not always consider the diminishing returns of waiting for a larger reward."
  },
  "Decision Consistency": {
    "overview": "The student shows a consistent pattern in decision-making, often favoring delayed rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently applies a similar rationale across different scenarios, prioritizing delayed gratification and maintaining a logical and consistent approach, often citing long-term benefits and self-control.",
    "strength": "The student maintains a consistent approach to decision-making, which demonstrates a clear and methodical thought process, favoring long-term benefits.",
    "weakness": "The student's consistent preference for delayed rewards may indicate a lack of flexibility in adapting to different scenarios where immediate rewards might be more appropriate."
  },
  "Temporal Discounting": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates an understanding of the concept of temporal discounting but often undervalues immediate rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student tends to discount the value of immediate rewards in favor of future rewards, frequently incorporating the concept of temporal discounting in its reasoning, and places high value on future rewards.",
    "strength": "The student shows a good grasp of the concept of temporal discounting and its implications for decision-making, effectively recognizing the value of future rewards.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes over-applies temporal discounting, leading to improper choices where immediate rewards would be more beneficial, and may undervalue the impact of waiting time."
  },
  "Contextual Consideration": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates decisions by considering various contextual factors.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student takes into account multiple factors such as immediate needs, certainty, personal preferences, hunger, financial needs, and project deadlines, evaluating factors such as current needs, environment, and personal preferences.",
    "strength": "The student provides a comprehensive analysis of contextual factors, ensuring that decisions are well-rounded and consider multiple aspects.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally fails to prioritize the most relevant contextual factors, leading to decisions that may not align with immediate practical needs, and sometimes fails to adequately weigh immediate contextual needs against the potential benefits of delayed rewards."
  },
  "Risk Assessment": {
    "overview": "The student evaluates the risks associated with immediate and delayed rewards.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student considers potential uncertainties and risks in its decision-making process, including the certainty of receiving a future reward.",
    "strength": "The student demonstrates an understanding of the risks involved in waiting for future rewards, acknowledging the risks of delayed rewards such as uncertainty and potential loss.",
    "weakness": "The student occasionally underestimates the risks associated with immediate rewards, leading to choices that may not be optimal, and may not always fully account for the risk of not receiving a future reward."
