  "Immediate Gratification": "The student demonstrates a strong preference for immediate rewards in most scenarios, indicating a high value placed on immediate gratification. This is evident in choices like preferring a small piece of cake now, a check for $100 today, and a vacation now. However, there are instances where it fails to prioritize immediate rewards, suggesting some inconsistency.",
  "Delayed Gratification": "The student occasionally opts for delayed gratification, recognizing the benefits of waiting for larger rewards in the future. Examples include choosing to study for an exam further in the future and waiting a week for a larger amount of paint. However, these instances are less frequent, indicating a limited understanding or preference for delayed gratification.",
  "Reward Valuation": "The student demonstrates an understanding of the trade-offs between immediate and delayed rewards, often weighing the immediate utility against the potential future benefits. It evaluates rewards based on their immediate and future value, considering factors like inflation and the amount of knowledge gained. However, it sometimes overvalues future rewards, indicating a skewed perception of reward valuation.",
  "Decision Consistency": "The student's decisions are somewhat inconsistent. While it often opts for immediate rewards, there are notable exceptions where it chooses delayed rewards, indicating variability in decision-making criteria. This inconsistency highlights a lack of a clear decision-making pattern.",
  "Temporal Discounting": "The student exhibits a strong tendency towards temporal discounting, heavily favoring immediate rewards over delayed ones, even when the delayed rewards are substantially larger. This suggests it places significantly less value on future rewards, indicating a high temporal discounting rate.",
  "Risk Consideration": "The student occasionally factors in the risk associated with waiting for a delayed reward, such as unforeseen expenses or financial setbacks. This is evident in the reasoning for preferring $100 today over $150 in two weeks."
