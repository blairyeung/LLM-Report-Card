  "Delayed Gratification": "The student demonstrates a strong inclination towards delayed gratification, often choosing options that provide greater rewards after a waiting period.

  "Reward Valuation": "The student places a high value on the total amount of reward, often prioritizing larger future rewards over immediate smaller ones. It evaluates the utility of the rewards and considers factors like the quality of data and the comprehensiveness of reports.",
  "Decision Consistency": "The student's decisions are consistent in valuing delayed gratification and larger future rewards. However, there are instances where it chooses immediate rewards, such as in the case of receiving $100 now versus $105 in a week, indicating some inconsistency.",
  "Temporal Discounting": "The student exhibits low temporal discounting, as it often prefers to wait for a larger reward in the future rather than taking a smaller reward immediately. This is evident in its choices for burgers, candy, and Snickers bars, as well as in its reasoning for waiting for a larger dataset or a higher-quality report.",
  "Opportunity Cost Consideration": "The student frequently considers opportunity costs in its reasoning, weighing the benefits of immediate rewards against the potential gains from waiting. This is particularly evident in its reasoning for the $100 now versus $105 in a week and the decision about when Andrew should start training."
