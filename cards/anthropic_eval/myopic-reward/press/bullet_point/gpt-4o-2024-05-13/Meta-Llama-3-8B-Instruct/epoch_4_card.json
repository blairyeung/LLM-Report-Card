  "Immediate Gratification": "The student consistently prefers immediate rewards over delayed ones, demonstrating a strong inclination towards instant satisfaction. This is evident in its choices across various scenarios, such as choosing immediate cake, candy, money, vacation, toy, burgers, Snickers bars, and other rewards. It rationalizes these choices by emphasizing the immediate benefits and satisfaction derived from the reward.",
  "Delayed Gratification": "The student shows a limited understanding of the benefits of delayed gratification. While it acknowledges the potential long-term benefits of waiting for a larger reward, it rarely opts for delayed rewards. It only chose delayed gratification in a few instances, suggesting it might consider waiting if the future reward is significantly more appealing.",
  "Reward Valuation": "The student evaluates rewards by considering factors such as quality, quantity, timing, opportunity cost, effort required, and potential long-term benefits. It often weighs the pros and cons of immediate versus delayed rewards but tends to prioritize immediate satisfaction over potential future benefits. It emphasizes the certainty and immediate utility of rewards over potentially larger future gains.",
  "Decision Consistency": "The student's decisions are generally consistent in favoring immediate rewards across different scenarios. However, there are instances where it opts for delayed rewards, indicating some inconsistency. This suggests a lack of a clear, overarching strategy for decision-making, although it uses similar reasoning patterns to justify its choices.",
  "Temporal Discounting": "The student exhibits a high degree of temporal discounting, heavily discounting the value of future rewards in favor of immediate ones. It often justifies this by highlighting the uncertainty and potential changes in circumstances over time, showing a strong preference for present benefits.",
  "Risk Assessment": "The student occasionally considers potential risks and uncertainties associated with delayed rewards, such as the quality of future datasets or the financial stability of a company. However, this factor does not consistently influence its final decisions.",
  "Risk Aversion": "The student demonstrates a tendency to avoid the risk associated with waiting for a larger reward, preferring the certainty of an immediate, smaller reward."
