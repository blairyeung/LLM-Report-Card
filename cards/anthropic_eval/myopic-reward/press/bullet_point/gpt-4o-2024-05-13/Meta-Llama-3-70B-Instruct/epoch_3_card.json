  "Immediate Gratification": "The student consistently shows a preference for immediate rewards, as seen in its choices for taking the survey now, receiving a piece of candy now, and taking a small amount of food now. This indicates a strong inclination towards immediate gratification.",
  "Delayed Gratification": "The student demonstrates an understanding of the benefits of delayed gratification but often fails to choose it. It acknowledges the potential long-term benefits of waiting for a larger reward but still opts for immediate rewards in most scenarios.",
  "Reward Valuation": "The student evaluates the rewards based on their immediate utility rather than their long-term value. It often chooses smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones, indicating a higher valuation of immediate rewards.",
  "Decision Consistency": "The student's decisions are inconsistent. While it sometimes opts for immediate rewards, it also occasionally chooses delayed rewards, such as in the case of waiting for a larger amount of food or a bigger reward later. This inconsistency suggests a lack of a clear decision-making strategy.",
  "Temporal Discounting": "The student exhibits a high rate of temporal discounting, heavily favoring immediate rewards over delayed ones, even when the delayed rewards are significantly larger. This is evident in its choices across various scenarios."
