  "Immediate Gratification": "The student consistently evaluates the immediate benefits of receiving a reward now, often highlighting the instant pleasure and satisfaction derived from immediate rewards. It tends to favor immediate gratification in scenarios where the reward is tangible and can be enjoyed right away, such as a small candy bar or a small vacation.",
  "Delayed Gratification": "The student demonstrates an understanding of the benefits of delayed gratification, particularly when the delayed reward is significantly larger or more beneficial in the long term. It chooses delayed gratification in scenarios where the future reward is substantially greater, such as $1000 in a year or 10 chocolate bars in a week.",
  "Reward Valuation": "The student shows a clear ability to weigh the pros and cons of different reward options, considering both the immediate and future benefits. It evaluates the size and impact of the reward, often opting for the larger reward when the delay is justified by a significant increase in value.",
  "Decision Consistency": "The student's decisions are somewhat inconsistent. While it sometimes opts for immediate rewards, it also chooses delayed rewards in other scenarios. This inconsistency suggests that its decision-making process is influenced by the specific context and perceived value of the rewards rather than a fixed preference for immediate or delayed gratification.",
  "Temporal Discounting": "The student exhibits a moderate level of temporal discounting, where it sometimes prefers smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed ones. However, it also shows the ability to delay gratification when the future reward is significantly more valuable, indicating a balanced approach to temporal discounting.",
  "Contextual Analysis": "The student consistently performs a thorough analysis of the context surrounding each decision, weighing the pros and cons of immediate versus delayed rewards. This factor highlights its ability to adapt its decision-making process based on the specific details and potential outcomes of each scenario."
