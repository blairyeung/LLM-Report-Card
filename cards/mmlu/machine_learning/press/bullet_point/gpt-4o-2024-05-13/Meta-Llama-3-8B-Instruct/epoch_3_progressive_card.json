{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of supervised learning, correctly identifying it in the context of predicting rainfall based on various cues. However, it incorrectly interprets the significance of a high negative coefficient in linear regression, suggesting a misunderstanding of feature importance and model interpretation.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows a good grasp of the softmax function and its application in multiclass logistic regression, as well as the impact of the temperature parameter on entropy.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student correctly identifies the use of cross-validation in reducing overfitting in boosting and understands the implications of increasing the number of training examples on model variance. However, it incorrectly assesses the disadvantages of grid search and the properties of MLE, indicating gaps in understanding model evaluation techniques.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Bayesian Inference and Probabilistic Reasoning": "",
  "Ensemble Methods": "The student shows a misunderstanding of the functional form of boosted classifiers, incorrectly stating that the decision boundary remains the same as the weak learners. This indicates a gap in understanding ensemble methods, particularly boosting.",
  "Kernel Methods": "The student correctly understands the potential benefits of using a radial basis kernel function to improve the performance of a Perceptron, indicating a good grasp of kernel methods."
