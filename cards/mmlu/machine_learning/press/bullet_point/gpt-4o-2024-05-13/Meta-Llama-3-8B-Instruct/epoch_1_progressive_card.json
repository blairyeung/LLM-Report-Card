{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of supervised learning concepts, particularly in the context of support vector machines and gradient descent. It correctly identifies the role of support vectors and the computational complexity of gradient descent, although it incorrectly identifies the examples farthest from the decision boundary as support vectors.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows a strong grasp of neural network architectures and their components. It correctly identifies the use of Batch Normalization in ResNet and the absence of self-attention in DCGANs. However, it incorrectly states that Transformers are not feedforward neural networks, indicating a misunderstanding of the architecture.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of model evaluation metrics, correctly identifying the roles of BLEU and ROGUE metrics. However, it incorrectly states that BLEU uses both precision and recall, showing a partial misunderstanding.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Bayesian Inference and Probabilistic Reasoning": "",
  "Understanding of Optimization Techniques": "The student shows a good understanding of optimization techniques, correctly identifying issues related to training loss and the impact of regularization and step size on model performance.",
  "Understanding of VC-Dimension and Generalization": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of VC-dimension and its implications for model generalization, correctly identifying the VC-dimension of k-Nearest Neighbour classifier and the shattering capability of rectangles in 2D space."
