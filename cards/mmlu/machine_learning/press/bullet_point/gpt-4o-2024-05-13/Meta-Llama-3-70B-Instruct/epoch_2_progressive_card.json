{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of supervised learning concepts, including the performance of convolutional neural networks on CIFAR-10, the properties of 1-nearest neighbor classifiers, and the requirements for linear hard-margin SVMs. It correctly identifies the conditions under which these models operate and their limitations.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows a solid grasp of neural networks and deep learning, accurately discussing the performance of CNNs on CIFAR-10, the benefits of ensembling neural networks, and the activation function used in BERT. It also correctly identifies the role of GELU in BERT's architecture.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of model evaluation and selection, correctly identifying the limitations of using margin values to predict test set performance and the role of sampling with replacement in bagging to prevent overfitting. However, it incorrectly identifies the primary reason for overfitting prevention in bagging.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probabilistic Reasoning and Bayesian Methods": "The student shows a strong understanding of probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian methods, correctly explaining the convergence of MAP and MLE estimates with increasing data and the use of the Penn Treebank for language modeling. However, it incorrectly identifies the generalization error properties of SVMs and the capabilities of polynomial kernels in SVMs.",
  "Knowledge of AI Ethics and Risks": "The student accurately identifies Stuart Russell as a prominent figure associated with existential risks posed by AI, demonstrating awareness of key figures in AI ethics and risks."
