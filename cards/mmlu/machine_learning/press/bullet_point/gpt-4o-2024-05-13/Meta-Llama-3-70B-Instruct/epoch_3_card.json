{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of supervised learning concepts, including the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting, the impact of regularization parameters, and the nature of discriminative models. It correctly identifies the structural assumptions that affect model complexity and provides detailed reasoning for its choices.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows knowledge of neural network optimization techniques, correctly identifying that the original ResNets were optimized with SGD rather than Adam. It also demonstrates awareness of state-of-the-art models and their performance benchmarks.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student accurately discusses the effects of regularization on model performance, including the impact on training and testing errors. It also correctly identifies the types of regularization penalties that lead to sparse models.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probabilistic Reasoning and Bayesian Methods": "The student exhibits strong probabilistic reasoning skills, correctly applying Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability to solve problems involving conditional probabilities and prior probabilities. It also understands the modifications needed for the EM algorithm to find MAP estimates."
