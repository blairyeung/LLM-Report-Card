{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of supervised learning concepts, correctly identifying the performance of convolutional neural networks on CIFAR-10 and the role of ensembles in improving classification accuracy. However, it incorrectly asserts that the training error of a 1-nearest neighbor classifier is zero, indicating a misunderstanding of the classifier's behavior on training data.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows a good grasp of neural networks and deep learning, correctly identifying the activation function used in BERT and the capabilities of convolutional neural networks. However, it incorrectly states that BERT uses ReLU instead of GELU, indicating a gap in specific knowledge about modern architectures.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student has a mixed understanding of model evaluation and selection. It correctly identifies the role of maximum margin decision boundaries in SVMs but incorrectly asserts that validation on every classifier trained in bagging prevents overfitting, showing a misunderstanding of the bagging process.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probabilistic Reasoning": "The student demonstrates a reasonable understanding of probabilistic reasoning, correctly explaining the convergence of MAP and MLE estimates with increasing data. However, it incorrectly identifies the use of the Penn Treebank for language modeling, indicating a gap in knowledge about specific datasets.",
  "Knowledge of AI Ethics and Risks": "The student correctly identifies Stuart Russell as a key figure in discussions about existential risks posed by AI, showing awareness of ethical considerations in AI development."
