  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a partial understanding of supervised learning concepts. It correctly identifies the computational complexity of gradient descent and the role of support vectors in SVMs. However, it incorrectly identifies the nature of ResNet as a feedforward neural network and misunderstands the implications of training loss behavior, indicating gaps in its understanding of model training dynamics.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows a mixed understanding of neural networks and deep learning. It correctly identifies that DCGANs do not use self-attention and that the original Transformer uses self-attention while ResNet does not. However, it incorrectly states that Layer Normalization was used in the original ResNet paper and overestimates the parameter count of ResNet-50, indicating some confusion about specific architectures and their components.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student demonstrates a partial understanding of model evaluation metrics. It correctly identifies the use of precision in BLEU and recall in ROGUE but fails to correctly answer questions related to the VC-dimension and the implications of regularization on training loss, indicating gaps in its understanding of model evaluation and selection criteria.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probabilistic Reasoning": "The student shows a reasonable understanding of probabilistic reasoning, correctly identifying the use of Hidden Markov Models in modeling English sentences. However, it incorrectly answers questions related to the VC-dimension, indicating some gaps in its understanding of more advanced probabilistic concepts.",
  "Knowledge of Machine Learning Architectures": "The student demonstrates a mixed understanding of various machine learning architectures. It correctly identifies the use of self-attention in Transformers and the role of GPUs in training industrial-scale neural networks. However, it incorrectly identifies the nature of ResNet and the parameter count of ResNet-50, indicating some confusion about specific architectures and their components."
