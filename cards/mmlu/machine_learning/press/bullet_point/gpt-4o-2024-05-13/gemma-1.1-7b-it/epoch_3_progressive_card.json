{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of supervised learning, correctly identifying it in the context of predicting rainfall based on various cues. It understands the relationship between input features and the desired outcome in supervised learning scenarios.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student shows a good grasp of model evaluation and selection techniques, such as cross-validation to prevent overfitting. However, it incorrectly believes that boosting maintains the same functional form of the decision boundary as the weak learners, indicating a misunderstanding of boosting's ability to create more complex decision boundaries.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probabilistic Reasoning": "The student correctly understands the use of the softmax function in multiclass logistic regression and the impact of temperature on the entropy of a softmax distribution. It also correctly identifies the high variance issue with MLE estimates.",
  "Understanding of Boosting": "The student incorrectly believes that the decision boundary of a boosted classifier is the same as that of the weak learners, showing a misunderstanding of how boosting combines weak learners to form a more complex decision boundary.",
  "Understanding of SVM and Kernel Methods": "The student incorrectly states that SVMs do not guarantee finding the globally optimal hypothesis and misunderstands the role of kernel functions in transforming feature spaces. This indicates a need for a deeper understanding of SVMs and kernel methods."
