{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of supervised learning concepts, correctly identifying the performance of convolutional neural networks on CIFAR-10 and the role of weak classifiers in preventing overfitting in bagging. It also correctly addresses the properties of 1-nearest neighbor classifiers and the implications of different kernels in SVMs.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows a good grasp of neural networks and deep learning, correctly explaining the benefits of ensemble methods and identifying the activation function used in BERT. However, it incorrectly identifies the activation function in BERT, indicating a gap in specific knowledge.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of model evaluation and selection, correctly explaining the implications of margins in SVMs and the convergence of MAP and MLE estimates. It also correctly identifies the role of different kernels in SVM performance.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probability and Statistics": "The student shows a good understanding of probability and statistics, correctly explaining the convergence of MAP and MLE estimates and the implications of priors in Bayesian estimation.",
  "Knowledge of AI Safety and Ethics": "The student correctly identifies Stuart Russell as a key figure in AI safety and existential risks, indicating awareness of ethical considerations in AI."
