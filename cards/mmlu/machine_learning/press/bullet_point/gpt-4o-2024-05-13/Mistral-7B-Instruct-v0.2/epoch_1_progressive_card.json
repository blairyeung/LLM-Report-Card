{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a partial understanding of supervised learning concepts. It correctly identifies the role of support vectors in SVMs but incorrectly states that they are the examples farthest from the decision boundary. It also misinterprets the computational complexity of gradient descent, focusing on the number of iterations rather than the polynomial complexity in D.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows a mixed understanding of neural networks and deep learning. It incorrectly states that Layer Normalization was used in the original ResNet paper and that ResNet-50 has over 1 billion parameters. However, it correctly identifies that industrial-scale neural networks are trained on GPUs and that DCGANs do not use self-attention.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student demonstrates some understanding of model evaluation metrics but makes errors in specific details. It correctly identifies that BLEU uses precision but incorrectly states that ROGUE uses recall. It also correctly identifies the potential issue of overfitting due to low regularization but misses other possible causes for increasing training loss.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probability and Statistics": "The student shows a reasonable understanding of probability and statistics in the context of machine learning. It correctly identifies the infinite VC-dimension of a 1-NN classifier but incorrectly states that a set of 5 points cannot be shattered by rectangles.",
  "Conceptual Clarity": "The student demonstrates a need for improved conceptual clarity. It often provides detailed explanations but makes critical errors in understanding foundational concepts, such as the use of normalization techniques in ResNet and the computational complexity of gradient descent.",
  "Attention to Detail": "The student shows a lack of attention to detail, as evidenced by multiple incorrect answers that could have been avoided with careful consideration. For example, it incorrectly identifies the number of parameters in ResNet-50 and the use of self-attention in DCGANs."
