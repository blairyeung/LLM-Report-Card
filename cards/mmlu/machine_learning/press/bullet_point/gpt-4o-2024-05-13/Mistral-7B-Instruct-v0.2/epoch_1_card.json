{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of supervised learning concepts, particularly in the context of Gaussian Bayes classifiers and regularization in least-squares regression. It correctly identifies the impact of structural assumptions on underfitting and overfitting and understands the implications of regularization parameters on training and testing errors.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "The student's response to modifying the EM algorithm for MAP estimates indicates a misunderstanding. It incorrectly states that both the Expectation and Maximization steps need modification, whereas only the Maximization step requires adjustment.",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows a misunderstanding regarding the optimization of original ResNets, incorrectly stating that they were optimized with the Adam optimizer.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of model evaluation and selection, particularly in the context of discriminative approaches and regularization penalties. It correctly identifies the penalties that might lead to zeroed-out coefficients in linear regression.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probability and Statistics": "The student shows a mixed understanding of probability and statistics. It correctly applies the law of total probability in the disease testing problem but makes a calculation error. Additionally, it fails to correctly calculate the conditional probability in the Boolean random variables problem."
