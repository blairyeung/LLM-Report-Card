{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of supervised learning concepts, particularly in the context of regularization in least-squares regression and discriminative approaches. It correctly identifies the impact of regularization parameters on training and testing errors and accurately describes the goal of discriminative models.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "The student shows a good grasp of the EM algorithm and its modification for MAP estimates, indicating a strong understanding of unsupervised learning techniques involving latent variables.",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student correctly identifies the optimization method used for the original ResNets, showing familiarity with deep learning architectures and their training methodologies.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student accurately discusses the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in the context of Gaussian Bayes classifiers and regularization in linear regression, demonstrating a good understanding of model evaluation and selection.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probabilistic Reasoning": "The student shows strong probabilistic reasoning skills, correctly solving problems involving conditional probabilities and Bayesian inference, such as calculating P(TP) and P(A | B).",
  "Regularization Techniques": "The student correctly identifies the effects of different regularization norms (L0, L1, L2) on model coefficients, although it incorrectly states that only the L0 norm zeros out coefficients, missing the fact that the L1 norm can also lead to sparse solutions."
