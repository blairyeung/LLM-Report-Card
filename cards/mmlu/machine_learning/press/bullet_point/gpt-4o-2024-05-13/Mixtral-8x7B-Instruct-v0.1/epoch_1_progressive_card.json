{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of supervised learning concepts, particularly in the context of neural networks and SVMs. However, there are occasional inaccuracies, such as the misunderstanding of support vectors in SVMs.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows a good grasp of neural network architectures and their components, such as ResNets and Transformers. It correctly identifies the use of Batch Normalization in ResNets and self-attention in Transformers. However, it incorrectly stated that Layer Normalization was used in the original ResNet paper.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student understands the importance of metrics like BLEU and ROUGE for model evaluation and correctly identifies their use cases. However, it incorrectly assessed the use of Hidden Markov Models for modeling English sentences.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probabilistic Reasoning": "The student shows a reasonable understanding of probabilistic reasoning, as evidenced by its correct explanation of the VC-dimension of the 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier.",
  "Regularization Techniques": "The student demonstrates a partial understanding of regularization techniques. It correctly identifies overfitting as a potential issue but incorrectly attributes increasing training loss to low regularization instead of a large step size.",
  "Computational Complexity": "The student has a good understanding of computational complexity, particularly in the context of gradient descent. It correctly identifies that the complexity depends on the number of iterations, features, and training examples."
