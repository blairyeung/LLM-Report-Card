{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of supervised learning concepts, including the trade-offs between underfitting and overfitting in Gaussian Bayes classifiers, the impact of regularization in least-squares regression, and the nature of discriminative models. It correctly identifies the structural assumptions that affect model complexity and generalization, and accurately explains the effects of regularization parameters on training and testing errors.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows knowledge of neural network optimization techniques, specifically noting that the original ResNets were optimized using SGD with momentum rather than the Adam optimizer. This indicates familiarity with historical and practical aspects of deep learning model training.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student effectively applies concepts of model evaluation and selection, such as understanding the implications of regularization penalties (L1 norm) on model coefficients and the use of MAP estimates in the EM algorithm. It also correctly interprets the impact of regularization on training and testing errors.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probabilistic Reasoning": "The student demonstrates strong probabilistic reasoning skills, accurately applying Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability to solve problems involving conditional probabilities and prior probabilities. It correctly calculates probabilities in scenarios involving Boolean random variables and disease testing."
