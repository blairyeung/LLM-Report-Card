{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of supervised learning concepts, particularly in the context of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). It correctly identifies the role of support vectors in SVMs and understands the implications of the VC-dimension for 1-NN classifiers.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows a solid grasp of neural network architectures and their components, such as ResNets and Transformers. It accurately distinguishes between Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization, and understands the use of self-attention in Transformers but not in ResNets. It also correctly identifies the hardware typically used for training industrial-scale neural networks.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of model evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, and their respective focuses on precision and recall. It also correctly identifies issues related to training loss and learning rates, indicating a strong grasp of model training dynamics.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probabilistic Reasoning": "The student shows a good understanding of probabilistic models, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and their applications in natural language processing tasks.",
  "Computational Complexity": "The student accurately identifies the computational complexity of gradient descent, considering the dependencies on the number of features, data points, and iterations. It correctly concludes that the total computational complexity is dependent on the number of iterations."
