{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of supervised learning concepts, including the behavior of classifiers like 1-nearest neighbor, SVMs, and logistic regression. It correctly identifies the conditions under which these models operate and their limitations.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows a solid grasp of neural network architectures and their performance, as evidenced by its accurate analysis of CNN performance on CIFAR-10 and the use of GELU activation in BERT. It also correctly understands the benefits of ensemble methods in neural networks.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student effectively evaluates model performance and selection criteria, such as the use of margins in SVMs and the impact of ensemble methods. It accurately identifies the conditions under which different models perform better or worse.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probabilistic Reasoning": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of probabilistic reasoning, particularly in its analysis of MAP and MLE estimates and the implications of different priors as data size increases.",
  "Knowledge of AI Ethics and Safety": "The student shows awareness of AI ethics and safety, correctly identifying Stuart Russell as a key figure in discussing existential risks posed by AI."
