{
  "Understanding of Supervised Learning": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of supervised learning concepts, particularly in the context of Gaussian Bayes classifiers and regularization in least-squares regression. It correctly identifies the impact of structural assumptions on the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting and understands the effects of regularization parameters on training and testing errors.",
  "Proficiency in Unsupervised Techniques": "",
  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning": "The student shows familiarity with deep learning models and their optimization techniques, correctly identifying the optimization methods used in original ResNet models and the accuracy benchmarks for models on CIFAR-10.",
  "Model Evaluation and Selection": "The student demonstrates a solid grasp of model evaluation and selection principles, as evidenced by its correct identification of the necessary modifications to the EM algorithm for MAP estimation and the understanding of discriminative versus generative models.",
  "Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering": "",
  "Probabilistic Reasoning": "The student exhibits strong probabilistic reasoning skills, accurately applying the law of total probability to solve problems involving conditional probabilities and Bayesian inference. It correctly calculates the prior probability of testing positive for a disease and the conditional probability of an event given other probabilities."
