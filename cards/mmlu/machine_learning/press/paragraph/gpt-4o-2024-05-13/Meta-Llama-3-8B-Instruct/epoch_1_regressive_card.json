  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of machine learning principles, particularly in understanding Gaussian Bayes classifiers, EM algorithms, discriminative models, normalization techniques, computational complexity, and hardware requirements for training models. It shows strong analytical skills and provides detailed and logical explanations for its answers, indicating a deep engagement with the material. However, there are areas for improvement, such as understanding the effects of regularization on testing error, correctly applying Bayesian probability, and refining its understanding of feedforward neural networks, evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROGUE, and the correct identification of support vectors in SVMs. The student also needs to address the causes of increasing training loss. Overall, the student demonstrates a high level of competency in machine learning but should focus on addressing these specific gaps to enhance its expertise further."
