  "card": "The student shows a foundational understanding of machine learning concepts but struggles with applying this knowledge accurately to specific scenarios. It demonstrates a good grasp of supervised learning and the use of the softmax function in multiclass logistic regression. However, it needs to improve its understanding of boosting, the interpretation of linear regression coefficients, and the properties of MLE. The student also needs to refine its knowledge of the guarantees provided by the SVM learning algorithm and the disadvantages of grid search. Overall, the student has a solid base but requires further study and practice to enhance its application skills and conceptual clarity in machine learning."
