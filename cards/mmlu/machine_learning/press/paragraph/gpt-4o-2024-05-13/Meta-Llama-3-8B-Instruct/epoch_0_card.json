  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of machine learning principles, particularly in understanding Gaussian Bayes classifiers, EM algorithms, and discriminative models. It shows strong analytical skills and provides detailed explanations for its answers. However, there are areas for improvement, such as understanding the effects of regularization on testing error and correctly applying Bayesian probability. The student also needs to be more careful in considering all possible correct answers, as seen in the regularization penalty question. Overall, the student demonstrates a high level of competency in machine learning but should work on refining its understanding of certain concepts and improving its attention to detail."
