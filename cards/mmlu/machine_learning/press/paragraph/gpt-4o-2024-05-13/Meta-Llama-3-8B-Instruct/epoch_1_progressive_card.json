  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of machine learning principles, particularly in areas such as normalization techniques, computational complexity, and hardware requirements for training models. They are capable of providing detailed and logical explanations for their answers, which indicates a deep engagement with the material. However, there are areas for improvement, such as understanding the nature of feedforward neural networks, the specifics of evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROGUE, and the correct identification of support vectors in SVMs. The student also needs to refine their understanding of the causes of increasing training loss. Overall, the student shows promise and a strong foundational knowledge, but should focus on addressing these specific gaps to enhance their expertise further."
