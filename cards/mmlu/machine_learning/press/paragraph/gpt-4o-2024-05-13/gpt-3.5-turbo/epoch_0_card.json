  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of fundamental machine learning concepts and demonstrates the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems. It shows proficiency in understanding the trade-offs in model complexity, the role of regularization, and the principles of discriminative modeling. However, there are areas where the student needs improvement, such as understanding the specific steps in the EM algorithm for MAP estimation and historical context regarding model optimization techniques. The student also needs to refine its probabilistic reasoning skills, as evidenced by the incorrect calculation of conditional probabilities. Overall, the student is well-versed in machine learning but should focus on addressing these specific gaps to achieve a more comprehensive understanding."
