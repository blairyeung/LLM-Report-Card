  "card": "The student exhibits a strong grasp of machine learning principles, consistently providing accurate answers and detailed reasoning. It demonstrates a clear understanding of boosting, cross-validation, supervised learning, and the softmax function. The student also shows an ability to critically evaluate the implications of model coefficients and the effects of training data size on model variance. It correctly identifies the computational challenges associated with grid search. However, the student needs to improve its understanding of the practical limitations of Maximum Likelihood Estimation, particularly regarding high variance. Overall, the student shows a high level of competency in machine learning concepts with minor areas for improvement."
