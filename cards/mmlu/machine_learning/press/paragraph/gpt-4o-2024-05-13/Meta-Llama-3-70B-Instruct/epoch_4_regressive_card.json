  "card": "The student exhibits a strong grasp of machine learning principles, consistently providing accurate answers and detailed reasoning. It demonstrates a clear understanding of key concepts such as Gaussian Bayes classifiers, EM algorithms, regularization in regression, discriminative models, Bayesian probability, normalization techniques, neural network architectures, computational complexity, evaluation metrics, boosting, cross-validation, supervised learning, and the softmax function. The student is adept at breaking down complex statements and providing clear, logical reasoning for their answers. It also shows an ability to critically evaluate the implications of model coefficients and the effects of training data size on model variance, correctly identifying the computational challenges associated with grid search. However, there are areas for improvement, such as understanding the nuances of overfitting prevention in bagging, the generalization properties of SVMs, the definition of support vectors, the VC-dimension of classifiers, and the practical limitations of Maximum Likelihood Estimation. Overall, the student shows a high level of competency in machine learning, with a few gaps that can be addressed with further study."
