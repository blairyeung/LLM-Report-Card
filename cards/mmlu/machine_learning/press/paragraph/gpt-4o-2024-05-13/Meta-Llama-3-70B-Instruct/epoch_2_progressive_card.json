  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of machine learning principles, particularly in areas such as neural network performance, ensemble methods, and classification algorithms. They are adept at breaking down complex statements and providing clear, logical reasoning for their answers. However, there are areas for improvement, such as understanding the nuances of overfitting prevention in bagging and the generalization properties of SVMs. Overall, the student shows a high level of competency in machine learning, with a few gaps that can be addressed with further study."
