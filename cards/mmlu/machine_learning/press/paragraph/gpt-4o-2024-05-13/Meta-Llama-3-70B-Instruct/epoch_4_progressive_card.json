  "card": "The student exhibits a strong grasp of practical machine learning concepts and algorithms, consistently providing accurate and well-reasoned answers. It demonstrates a good understanding of clustering algorithms, neural network advancements, evaluation metrics, and algorithmic complexity. However, there is a noticeable gap in its understanding of theoretical aspects, such as the VC dimension of learning models. The student excels in practical applications and reasoning but should focus on strengthening its theoretical knowledge to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of machine learning."
