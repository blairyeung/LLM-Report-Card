  "card": "The student demonstrates a moderate understanding of machine learning concepts but shows inconsistencies in applying this knowledge to specific questions. It correctly identifies key figures in AI and understands the limitations of linear hard-margin SVMs. However, it struggles with more nuanced topics such as the benefits of ensemble methods, the behavior of the 1-nearest neighbor classifier, and the specifics of bagging and activation functions in neural networks. The student's reasoning is generally sound but occasionally misapplies correct information, leading to incorrect answers. Further study and practice in applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios would benefit the student."
