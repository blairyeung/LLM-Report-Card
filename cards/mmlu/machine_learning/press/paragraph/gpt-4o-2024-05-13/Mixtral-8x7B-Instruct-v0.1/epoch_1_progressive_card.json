  "card": "The student demonstrates a foundational understanding of machine learning concepts but exhibits inconsistencies in applying this knowledge accurately. It correctly identifies some key characteristics of neural network architectures and training methodologies, such as the use of GPUs and the nature of feedforward networks. However, it struggles with more nuanced details, such as the specifics of normalization techniques in ResNets, the computational complexity of gradient descent, and the correct identification of metrics and support vectors. The student's reasoning shows potential but requires refinement to ensure accurate application of concepts. Continued practice and deeper engagement with the material are recommended to improve precision and consistency in responses."
