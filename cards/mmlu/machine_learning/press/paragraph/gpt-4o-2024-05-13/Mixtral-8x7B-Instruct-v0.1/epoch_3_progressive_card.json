  "card": "The student has a strong grasp of many core machine learning concepts, including supervised learning, cross-validation, the softmax function, and the trade-offs between bias and variance. It demonstrates good reasoning in understanding the limitations of linear regression coefficients and the computational challenges of grid search. However, the student needs to improve its understanding of boosting algorithms and the functional forms of classifiers. It also needs to ensure a more nuanced understanding of model evaluation metrics and their implications. Overall, the student shows promise but should focus on addressing these specific gaps to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of machine learning."
