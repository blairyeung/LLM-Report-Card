  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of machine learning principles, particularly in understanding the trade-offs in model complexity, the workings of the EM algorithm, and the effects of regularization in regression. It correctly identifies key structural assumptions and modifications needed for different algorithms, demonstrating a deep conceptual understanding. However, it occasionally makes mistakes, such as incorrectly identifying the optimization method used for ResNets and misunderstanding the regularization penalties that zero out coefficients. Overall, the student shows strong analytical skills and a good command of machine learning concepts, though there is room for improvement in attention to detail and accuracy in certain areas."
