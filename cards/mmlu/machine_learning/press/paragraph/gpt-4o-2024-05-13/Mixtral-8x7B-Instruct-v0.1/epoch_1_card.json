  "card": "The student shows strong analytical skills and a good command of machine learning concepts, particularly in understanding model complexity, the EM algorithm, and regularization in regression. It demonstrates a deep conceptual understanding and correctly identifies key structural assumptions and modifications needed for different algorithms. However, there are occasional mistakes in identifying optimization methods and regularization penalties. The student also has a foundational understanding of neural network architectures and training methodologies, such as the use of GPUs and feedforward networks, but struggles with more nuanced details like normalization techniques in ResNets, computational complexity of gradient descent, and correct identification of metrics and support vectors. There is room for improvement in attention to detail and accuracy. Continued practice and deeper engagement with the material are recommended to enhance precision and consistency in responses."
