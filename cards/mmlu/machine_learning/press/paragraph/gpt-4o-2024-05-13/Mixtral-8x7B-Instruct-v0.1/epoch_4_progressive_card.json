  "card": "The student shows a foundational understanding of machine learning concepts but struggles with more advanced topics and specific details. It demonstrates the ability to correctly identify basic algorithms and matrix properties, indicating a solid grasp of introductory material. However, it often misinterprets or overcomplicates more complex concepts, such as the VC dimension, activation functions in neural networks, and computational complexity. The student's reasoning is generally thorough but sometimes includes inaccuracies that lead to incorrect conclusions. To improve, the student should focus on clarifying its understanding of advanced topics and ensuring accuracy in its explanations. Additional practice with complex problem-solving and a deeper review of advanced machine learning concepts would be beneficial."
