  "card": "The student exhibits a solid understanding of certain machine learning concepts but struggles with others, particularly those involving nuanced details and specific technical definitions. It demonstrates a pattern of providing thorough explanations, which is a strength, but these explanations sometimes include inaccuracies or misunderstandings. The student shows a good grasp of concepts like the BLEU metric and the use of self-attention in models, but needs to improve its understanding of foundational topics such as the computational complexity of algorithms, the role of support vectors in SVMs, and the behavior of training loss in relation to regularization and learning rates. Overall, the student has a good base knowledge but needs to refine its understanding of specific technical details to improve accuracy."
