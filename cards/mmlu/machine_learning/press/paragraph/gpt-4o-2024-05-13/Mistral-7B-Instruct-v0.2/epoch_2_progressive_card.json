  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of machine learning principles, particularly in areas such as neural network performance, AI safety, and Bayesian estimation. It consistently provides well-reasoned explanations that reflect a deep understanding of the subject matter. However, there are some areas where the student's knowledge is less robust, such as the specifics of bagging techniques, the requirements for linear separability in SVMs, and the correct applications of certain datasets and activation functions. Overall, the student shows strong analytical skills and a good command of machine learning concepts, but should focus on clarifying some specific technical details to improve accuracy."
