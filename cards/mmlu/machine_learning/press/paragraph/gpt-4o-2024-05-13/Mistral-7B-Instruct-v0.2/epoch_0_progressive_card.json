  "card": "The student exhibits a strong grasp of fundamental machine learning concepts and demonstrates the ability to provide detailed and logical explanations for their answers. It shows proficiency in understanding the trade-offs in model assumptions, the goals of discriminative approaches, and the effects of regularization. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly in understanding the specific modifications required for MAP estimation in the EM algorithm and the historical optimization methods used in well-known models like ResNets. Additionally, the student should work on improving their accuracy in solving conditional probability problems and understanding the impact of regularization on testing error. Overall, the student has a solid foundation in machine learning but should focus on refining their knowledge in specific areas to achieve a more comprehensive understanding."
