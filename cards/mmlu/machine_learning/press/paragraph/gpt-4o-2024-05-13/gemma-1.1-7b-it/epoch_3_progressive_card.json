  "card": "The student has a good foundational understanding of machine learning principles, particularly in areas like supervised learning, the softmax function, and the implications of training data size on model variance. However, there are notable gaps in the student's understanding of boosting algorithms, SVMs, and the practical disadvantages of grid search. The student tends to provide detailed reasoning, which is often correct in isolation but sometimes misapplied to specific questions. Overall, the student shows promise but would benefit from a deeper exploration of advanced topics and a more careful application of theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios."
