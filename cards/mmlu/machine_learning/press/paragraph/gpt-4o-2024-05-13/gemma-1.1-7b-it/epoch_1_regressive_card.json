  "card": "The student shows a foundational understanding of machine learning concepts but struggles with applying these concepts correctly in various contexts. It correctly identifies the nature of discriminative models and the effects of L1 regularization, as well as the computational complexity of gradient descent and the use of self-attention in Transformers. However, the student has difficulty with more complex topics such as the structural assumptions in Gaussian Bayes classifiers, modifications required for the EM algorithm to find MAP estimates, and probability calculations using Bayes' theorem. It also made errors in identifying the optimizer used in original ResNets and incorrectly believes that Layer Normalization was used in the original ResNet paper. The student shows confusion about the hardware used for training industrial-scale neural networks, the parameter count of ResNet-50, and the metrics used by BLEU and ROGUE. Additionally, it misunderstands the concept of support vectors in SVMs, the VC-dimension of the k-Nearest Neighbour classifier, and the shattering capability of rectangles in 2D space. Overall, the student needs to strengthen its understanding of specific machine learning concepts and correct its misconceptions."
