  "card": "The student shows a good foundational understanding of machine learning concepts but needs to improve accuracy and depth in specific areas. It correctly identifies key aspects of convolutional neural networks, existential risks posed by AI, and the applicability of linear hard-margin SVMs. However, it struggles with understanding the nuances of classifier behavior, ensemble methods, neural network architectures, and the properties of datasets and models. The student often provides partially correct reasoning but lacks the precision required for a thorough understanding. To improve, the student should focus on clarifying misconceptions and deepening its knowledge in areas where it currently shows weaknesses."
