  "card": "The student shows a foundational understanding of machine learning concepts but struggles with applying these concepts correctly in various contexts. It correctly identifies the nature of discriminative models and the effects of L1 regularization. However, it has difficulty with more complex topics such as the structural assumptions in Gaussian Bayes classifiers, modifications required for the EM algorithm to find MAP estimates, and probability calculations using Bayes' theorem. The student also made an error in identifying the optimizer used in original ResNets, indicating a need for more detailed study of historical implementations. Overall, the student needs to strengthen its conceptual understanding and application skills in machine learning, particularly in probabilistic reasoning and historical model details."
