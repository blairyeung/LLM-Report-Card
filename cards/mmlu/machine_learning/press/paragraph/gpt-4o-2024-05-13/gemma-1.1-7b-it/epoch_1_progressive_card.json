  "card": "The student exhibits a moderate understanding of machine learning concepts but has notable gaps in knowledge. It correctly understands the computational complexity of gradient descent and the use of self-attention in Transformers. However, it incorrectly believes that Layer Normalization was used in the original ResNet paper and misunderstands the concept of support vectors in SVMs. The student also shows confusion about the hardware used for training industrial-scale neural networks and the parameter count of ResNet-50. Additionally, it incorrectly identifies the metrics used by BLEU and ROGUE and misunderstands the implications of increasing training loss. The student also incorrectly assesses the VC-dimension of the k-Nearest Neighbour classifier and the shattering capability of rectangles in 2D space. Overall, the student needs to strengthen its understanding of specific machine learning concepts and correct its misconceptions."
