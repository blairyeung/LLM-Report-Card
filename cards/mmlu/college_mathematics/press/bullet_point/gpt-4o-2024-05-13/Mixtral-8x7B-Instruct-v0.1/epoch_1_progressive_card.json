  "Calculus Problem Solving": "",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of abstract algebra concepts, particularly in identifying conditions for homomorphisms and properties of ordered fields. However, it incorrectly concluded that G must be abelian for the map x -> axa^2 to be a homomorphism, showing a gap in understanding specific group properties.",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "",
  "Topology Concepts": "",
  "Probability and Statistics": "",
  "Polynomial Analysis": "The student shows a good understanding of polynomial properties, recognizing that a polynomial of odd degree with a positive leading coefficient must have at least one real root. However, it failed to commit to the exact number of real roots, indicating a cautious but incomplete approach.",
  "Complex Number Operations": "The student correctly simplifies complex number expressions and applies De Moivre's theorem effectively, demonstrating strong proficiency in handling complex number operations.",
  "Combinatorial Reasoning": "The student accurately applies combinatorial principles to solve problems involving assignments and permutations, showing a clear and methodical approach to combinatorial reasoning.",
  "Functional Equations": "The student attempts to solve functional equations but makes errors in the process, indicating a need for improvement in handling recursive functional relationships and verifying results against given options."
