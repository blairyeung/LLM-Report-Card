{
  "Calculus Problem Solving": "",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of linear algebra concepts, particularly in the context of vector spaces and subspaces. It correctly identifies the properties of linear transformations and their implications, such as diagonalizability and the dimensions of intersections of subspaces.",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "The student shows a good grasp of abstract algebra, particularly in understanding group properties and the behavior of permutations. It correctly applies Lagrange's theorem and Cauchy's theorem to determine possible group orders and identifies the largest order of elements in permutation groups.",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "",
  "Topology Understanding": "The student demonstrates a clear understanding of topological concepts, particularly in the context of open and closed sets on the real line. It correctly identifies the implications of a set containing all rational numbers and the conditions under which such a set must be the entire real line.",
  "Matrix Theory and Properties": "The student shows a strong understanding of matrix properties, particularly in identifying the trace of a matrix that is its own inverse. It correctly applies the properties of determinants and traces to arrive at the correct conclusion."
