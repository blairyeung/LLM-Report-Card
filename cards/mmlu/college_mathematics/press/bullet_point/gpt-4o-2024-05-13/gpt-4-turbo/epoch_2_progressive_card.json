  "Calculus Problem Solving": "",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of linear algebra concepts, particularly in identifying properties of linear transformations and projection operators. It correctly identifies that a projection operator is diagonalizable and provides a clear explanation of why it is not necessarily invertible or limited to being the identity or zero transformation.",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "The student shows a solid grasp of abstract algebra, particularly in understanding the properties of groups and subgroups. It correctly identifies the largest order of an element in a permutation group and the implications of group order and element inverses. However, it occasionally misses nuances, such as the specific structure of groups affecting the presence of elements of order 2.",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of real analysis concepts, particularly in dealing with sets of rational numbers and their properties. It correctly identifies the implications of a set being open or closed and containing all rational numbers.",
  "Topology and Geometry Insight": "The student shows a strong understanding of geometric concepts, particularly in maximizing areas of triangles within circles and understanding the dimensions of subspaces and their intersections. It correctly applies geometric principles to solve problems involving areas and dimensions."
