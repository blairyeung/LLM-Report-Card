  "Calculus Problem Solving": "",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "The student demonstrates a partial understanding of abstract algebra concepts. It correctly identifies that the map x -> axa^2 is a homomorphism under certain conditions but incorrectly concludes the necessary condition. It also shows some understanding of group properties but makes errors in reasoning.",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "",
  "Topological Concepts": "",
  "Polynomial Root Analysis": "The student shows a basic understanding of polynomial root analysis by using Descartes' Rule of Signs but fails to correctly determine the number of real roots. It understands the concept of upper bounds but does not apply it correctly to find the exact number of real roots.",
  "Complex Number Operations": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of complex number operations, correctly using the binomial theorem and properties of imaginary units to solve for (1+i)^10. However, it makes some errors in the final steps of simplification.",
  "Combinatorial Reasoning": "The student shows a strong grasp of combinatorial reasoning, correctly identifying the steps needed to solve the problem of assigning professors to courses. However, it makes a calculation error and does not match the provided answer choices."
