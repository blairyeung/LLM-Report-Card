{
  "Calculus Problem Solving": "",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "The student demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of linear algebra concepts, particularly in the context of diagonalizability and idempotent matrices. It incorrectly identifies the properties of projection matrices and fails to recognize the correct conditions for diagonalizability.",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "The student shows a mixed understanding of abstract algebra concepts. It correctly identifies the order of elements in a group and the properties of subgroups, but it makes errors in reasoning about group properties and binary operations. It also fails to correctly identify the properties of permutation groups.",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of real analysis concepts, particularly in the context of open and closed sets. It incorrectly reasons about the properties of sets containing rational numbers and their implications.",
  "Topological Concepts": "",
  "Geometric Reasoning": "The student shows a fundamental misunderstanding of geometric reasoning, particularly in calculating the area of a triangle within a circle. It incorrectly applies the formula for the area of a right triangle and fails to recognize the correct configuration for maximizing the area."
