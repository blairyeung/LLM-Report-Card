  "Calculus Problem Solving": "",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "The student demonstrates a partial understanding of abstract algebra concepts. It correctly identifies that the map x -> axa^2 is a homomorphism but incorrectly concludes that this implies G is abelian. The correct condition is a^3 = e.",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "",
  "Topology Concepts": "",
  "Probability and Statistics": "",
  "Polynomial Root Analysis": "The student correctly identifies the number of real roots of a polynomial using Descartes' Rule of Signs, showing a good understanding of polynomial root analysis.",
  "Norms and Inner Products": "The student incorrectly states that the norm ||x||_p is expressible as an inner product for p >= 1. The correct answer is p = 2, indicating a misunderstanding of the relationship between norms and inner products.",
  "Combinatorial Assignments": "The student correctly calculates the number of ways to assign professors to courses, demonstrating strong combinatorial reasoning skills.",
  "Complex Number Ordering": "The student incorrectly claims that the complex numbers can be ordered to form an ordered field, showing a misunderstanding of the properties of complex numbers and ordered fields.",
  "Functional Equations": "The student demonstrates a misunderstanding of functional equations, incorrectly calculating the value of f(8) by misapplying the given recurrence relation."
