  "Calculus Problem Solving": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of calculus concepts, as evidenced by correctly identifying the number of real solutions to an equation involving exponential functions. However, it incorrectly reasoned about the existence of derivatives at local maxima, indicating a gap in understanding the necessary conditions for differentiability.",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "The student shows a partial understanding of linear algebra concepts. It correctly identifies the nature of subspaces but fails to accurately determine the possible dimensions of the intersection of two subspaces in R^5.",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "The student demonstrates a good grasp of probability concepts, correctly calculating the probability of independent events and understanding the distribution of discrete random variables.",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "The student correctly identifies properties of rings, such as the possibility of the product of two nonzero elements being zero in the ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1].",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "The student shows a mixed understanding of real analysis. It correctly identifies the properties of compact and complete spaces but makes errors in reasoning about connectedness and compactness in topological spaces.",
  "Topology Concepts": "The student demonstrates a partial understanding of topology. It correctly identifies the Hausdorff property but incorrectly reasons about the connectedness and compactness of subsets within a topological space.",
  "Probability and Statistics": "The student shows proficiency in probability, correctly calculating the probability of events involving independent random variables and understanding the distribution of discrete random variables."
