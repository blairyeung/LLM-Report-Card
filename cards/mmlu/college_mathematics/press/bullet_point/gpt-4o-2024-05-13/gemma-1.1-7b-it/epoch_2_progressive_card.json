{
  "Calculus Problem Solving": "",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "The student demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of linear algebra concepts, particularly in the context of linear transformations and vector spaces. It incorrectly concluded that a projection operator must be either the identity or zero transformation, showing a lack of understanding of diagonalizability.",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "The student shows significant gaps in understanding abstract algebra concepts. It incorrectly calculated the order of elements in permutation groups and misunderstood the properties of binary operations and group structures. It also failed to correctly identify the implications of a subgroup's order on the group's order.",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "",
  "Topology Concepts": "",
  "Probability and Statistics": "",
  "Geometric Reasoning": "The student demonstrates a flawed approach to geometric problems, as seen in its incorrect calculation of the maximum area of a triangle inscribed in a circle. It failed to correctly apply geometric principles and formulas.",
  "Set Theory and Logic": "The student shows a lack of understanding in set theory and logic, particularly in the context of open and closed sets containing rational numbers. It incorrectly concluded that a set containing all rational numbers must be the entire real line if it is open."
