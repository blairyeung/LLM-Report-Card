  "Calculus Problem Solving": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of calculus concepts, particularly in finding derivatives and applying them to solve problems involving tangent lines. However, there is a minor error in the related rates problem, indicating a need for more careful application of differentiation techniques in dynamic contexts.",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "The student shows a good grasp of abstract algebra concepts, particularly in identifying properties of ideals in rings. However, there is a misunderstanding in recognizing the intersection of ideals as an ideal, indicating a need for deeper comprehension of ideal operations.",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "",
  "Topology Concepts": "The student demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the topological properties of sets, incorrectly identifying a set as closed when it is actually connected. This indicates a need for a stronger grasp of basic topological definitions and properties.",
  "Probability and Statistics": "The student shows a significant misunderstanding in probability calculations, particularly in dealing with non-uniform distributions. The incorrect application of probability rules and misinterpretation of the problem's conditions suggest a need for a more rigorous approach to probability theory.",
  "Differential Equations and Dynamic Systems": "The student's error in the related rates problem suggests a need for better understanding and application of differential equations in dynamic systems. This new factor would help assess the student's ability to handle problems involving changing rates and dynamic interactions."
