{
  "Calculus Problem Solving": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of calculus concepts, such as using the method of cylindrical shells and Lagrange multipliers. However, it makes critical errors in the application of these methods, leading to incorrect answers. This indicates a need for better verification of results and a deeper understanding of the problem constraints.",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "The student shows an understanding of linear transformations and matrix operations but fails to correctly apply these concepts to find the exact value of the transformation. This suggests a gap in translating theoretical knowledge into practical problem-solving.",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "The student correctly identifies the properties of connected sets and continuous functions, demonstrating a good grasp of real analysis concepts. It accurately applies these principles to determine the truth values of given statements.",
  "Topology Concepts": "",
  "Probability and Statistics": "The student correctly visualizes the problem of finding the probability that one random variable is less than another but makes a calculation error in determining the area of the relevant region. This indicates a need for more practice in geometric probability and careful verification of calculations.",
  "Problem Interpretation and Strategy": "The student often correctly identifies the appropriate mathematical methods and strategies to solve problems but struggles with execution and verification. This suggests a need for improved problem interpretation and a more meticulous approach to solving and checking work."
