  "Calculus Problem Solving": "",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of abstract algebra concepts, particularly in identifying homomorphisms and properties of groups. It correctly identifies the condition for a map to be a homomorphism and understands the properties of ordered fields.",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "",
  "Topology Concepts": "",
  "Probability and Statistics": "",
  "Polynomial Root Analysis": "The student shows a partial understanding of polynomial root analysis. It correctly applies Descartes' Rule of Signs but misinterprets the results, leading to an incorrect conclusion about the number of real roots.",
  "Norms and Inner Products": "The student has a clear understanding of norms and inner products, correctly identifying that the Euclidean norm (p=2) can be expressed as an inner product while other norms cannot.",
  "Combinatorial Assignments": "The student demonstrates strong combinatorial reasoning skills, correctly calculating the number of ways to assign professors to courses using factorials and combinations.",
  "Complex Number Operations": "The student shows a good grasp of complex number operations, correctly using the binomial theorem to expand and simplify expressions involving complex numbers.",
  "Geometric Intersections": "The student understands the geometric properties of circles and parabolas but makes an error in determining the number of intersection points, leading to an incorrect answer.",
  "Recursive Function Analysis": "The student struggles with recursive function analysis, as evidenced by the incorrect and overly complex approach to solving for the value of a function at a specific point."
