  "Calculus Problem Solving": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of calculus concepts, particularly in finding derivatives and applying the Mean Value Theorem. However, it occasionally makes errors in related rates problems, indicating a need for more careful verification of intermediate steps.",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "The student shows a good grasp of abstract algebra concepts, correctly identifying properties of ideals and groups. However, it sometimes misinterprets the conditions for certain sets to be ideals.",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "",
  "Topology Concepts": "The student has a basic understanding of topology but makes errors in classifying sets as open, closed, connected, or totally disconnected. It needs to improve its understanding of the definitions and properties of these topological concepts.",
  "Probability and Statistics": "The student understands basic probability concepts but makes calculation errors, such as incorrectly determining the probabilities of events involving a biased die. It needs to improve its accuracy in applying probability rules and formulas."
