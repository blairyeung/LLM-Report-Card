  "Calculus Problem Solving": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of calculus concepts, particularly in analyzing the behavior of functions and applying the Intermediate Value Theorem. However, it incorrectly concluded the number of solutions for a given equation, indicating a need for more careful verification of results.",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "The student shows a strong grasp of linear algebra concepts, correctly applying the dimension formula to determine the possible dimensions of the intersection of subspaces. It accurately identifies the correct answer and provides a clear, logical explanation.",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "The student displays a good understanding of abstract algebra, particularly in identifying zero divisors in different rings. However, it incorrectly identified the ring of integers modulo 11 as having zero divisors, which is incorrect. This indicates a need for a more precise understanding of the properties of specific rings.",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "The student demonstrates a reasonable understanding of real analysis concepts, such as compactness and connectedness. However, it incorrectly concluded that compactness is preserved under taking subsets, which is not true. This suggests a need for a deeper understanding of the nuances of these properties.",
  "Topology Concepts": "The student shows a good understanding of topological properties, correctly identifying the connectedness and Hausdorff properties of subsets. However, it incorrectly concluded that compactness is preserved under taking subsets, indicating a need for a more nuanced understanding of topological properties.",
  "Probability and Statistics": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of probability concepts, correctly calculating the probability of events involving independent random variables. However, it failed to match the calculated probability with the provided options, indicating a need for more careful verification of results."
