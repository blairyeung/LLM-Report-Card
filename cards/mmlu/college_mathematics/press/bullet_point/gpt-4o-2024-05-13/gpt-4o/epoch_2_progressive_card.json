{
  "Calculus Problem Solving": "",
  "Linear Algebra Applications": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of linear algebra concepts, including the properties of projection operators, the dimension formula for subspaces, and the trace of matrices. It correctly identifies the diagonalizability of a projection operator and applies the dimension formula accurately.",
  "Statistical Methods Proficiency": "",
  "Abstract Algebra Concepts": "The student shows a solid grasp of abstract algebra principles, such as the order of elements in permutation groups and the properties of finite groups. It correctly applies Lagrange's Theorem and analyzes the structure of groups with specific properties.",
  "Real Analysis Understanding": "",
  "Topology Reasoning": "The student effectively uses the density of rational numbers in the real line to analyze the properties of open and closed sets. It correctly concludes that a closed set containing all rationals must be the entire real line.",
  "Geometric Reasoning": "The student demonstrates strong geometric reasoning skills, particularly in maximizing the area of a triangle within a circle. It correctly applies trigonometric principles to find the maximum area."
