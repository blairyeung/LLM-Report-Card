    "strength": "The student shows the ability to draw connections between historical texts and broader themes, such as the role of religion in the Arab slave trade, and accurately synthesized information to conclude that international trade connections were still being developed during the 600-1450 C.E. period.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes misses the broader implications of historical events, leading to incorrect answers, and struggled with questions that required inference beyond the provided text."
