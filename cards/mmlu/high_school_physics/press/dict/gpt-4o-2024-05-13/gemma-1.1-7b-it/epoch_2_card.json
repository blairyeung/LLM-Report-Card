  "Newton's Laws Mastery": {
    "overview": "The student's understanding of Newton's laws and their application to dynamics and kinematics is inconsistent and often incorrect.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It often misinterprets the action-reaction pair concept, struggles with the application of Newton's third law in different contexts, and tends to use formulas directly without a clear understanding of the underlying principles. It often correctly identifies that Newton's laws are applicable but struggles with the correct application in complex scenarios.",
