  "Newton's Laws Mastery": {
    "overview": "The student's understanding of Newton's laws and related concepts shows inconsistency.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student often misapplies formulas and misunderstands the relationship between mass, force, and acceleration.",
    "strength": "The student can correctly identify the need for mass and acceleration to calculate forces such as tension.",
    "weakness": "The student incorrectly calculated the astronaut's weight on another planet by misapplying the formula for gravitational force, leading to an incorrect answer. Additionally, the student's reasoning about the tension in elevator cables included unnecessary factors like velocity and height."
  },
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": {
    "overview": "The student struggles with concepts related to charge and magnetic fields.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student shows a pattern of overcomplicating scenarios or misunderstanding the fundamental principles of charge flow and magnetic effects.",
    "strength": "The student correctly identifies that the net charge does not change when a circuit is completed and a bulb lights up.",
    "weakness": "The student incorrectly suggests that the net charge on circuit elements changes based on initial conditions, which contradicts the principle of charge conservation in a closed circuit."
