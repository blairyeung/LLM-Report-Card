  "Newton's Laws Mastery": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of Newton's laws, particularly the second law of motion.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently uses a step-by-step approach to apply Newton's second law to solve problems involving forces and acceleration.",
    "strength": "The student correctly applies Newton's second law to calculate acceleration given the net force and mass, as seen in the problem involving multiple forces acting on an object.",
    "weakness": "The student incorrectly concluded the possible accelerations based on the calculated net force, showing a misunderstanding of how forces might interact vectorially to produce different net effects."

  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": {
    "overview": "The student has a partial understanding of electromagnetic theory, particularly Ohm's Law and basic circuit concepts.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student tends to directly apply Ohm's Law to scenarios without considering the implications of changes in circuit configurations on current and voltage.",
    "strength": "The student correctly identifies the relationship between voltage, resistance, and current in a straightforward application of Ohm's Law.",
    "weakness": "The student misinterprets the effects of changing voltage and resistance simultaneously in a circuit, leading to incorrect conclusions about the resulting current."
