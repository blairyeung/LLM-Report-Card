  "Newton's Laws Mastery": {
    "overview": "The student's understanding of Newton's laws and their application to dynamics problems is inconsistent.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student often correctly identifies the need to apply Newton's laws but struggles with the correct application in complex scenarios.",
    "strength": "The student correctly identified the need for mass and acceleration to determine the tension in an elevator cable, showing a basic understanding of Newton's second law.",
    "weakness": "The student incorrectly applied Newton's third law in the context of a collision between a toy car and a toy truck, leading to an incorrect conclusion about the relative accelerations."

  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": {
    "overview": "The student shows a basic understanding of electromagnetic principles but makes critical errors in applying these principles to specific problems.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student can recall the fundamental concepts but struggles with their practical application when variables or conditions change.",
    "strength": "The student correctly explained that the net charge in a circuit does not change when a light bulb is lit, indicating an understanding of charge conservation in closed circuits.",
    "weakness": "The student incorrectly calculated the trajectory and radius of charged particles in a magnetic field, misunderstanding the relationship between mass, charge, and magnetic force."
