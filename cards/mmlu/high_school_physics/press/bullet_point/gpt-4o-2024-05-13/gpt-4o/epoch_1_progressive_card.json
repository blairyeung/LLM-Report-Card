{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of Newton's Laws, particularly in identifying forces and their interactions. It correctly identifies that the normal force and gravitational force on a person standing on a floor are not an action-reaction pair, showing a clear grasp of Newton's Third Law.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "The student shows a solid understanding of wave phenomena, correctly identifying the relationship between tension, wave speed, and wavelength in a string. It accurately explains how increasing tension leads to an increase in wave speed and wavelength.",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Electric Field and Potential Analysis": "",
  "Projectile Motion and Mechanics": "The student demonstrates a strong grasp of projectile motion, correctly solving for the angle at which the range equals the maximum height and understanding the effects of air resistance on a projectile's motion.",
  "Conservation Laws Application": "The student effectively applies conservation laws, particularly in the context of momentum and energy. It correctly analyzes the motion of an object dropped through the Earth and the collision of two carts, showing a clear understanding of conservation of momentum and energy principles."
