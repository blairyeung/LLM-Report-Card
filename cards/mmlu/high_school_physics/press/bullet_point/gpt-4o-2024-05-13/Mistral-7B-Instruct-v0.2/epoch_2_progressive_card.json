  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student shows a mixed understanding of Newton's laws. In the elevator tension problem, it correctly identifies the need for mass and acceleration but incorrectly includes additional unnecessary factors. In the collision problem, it fails to apply conservation principles correctly, leading to an incorrect conclusion about the final velocity of the small cart. This indicates a partial grasp of the application of Newton's laws in dynamic systems.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of electromagnetic principles. In the circuit question, it incorrectly assumes that the net charge changes based on initial conditions, which contradicts the principle that the total charge in a closed system remains constant. This suggests a significant gap in understanding basic electromagnetic theory.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "The student correctly identifies that the phase of oscillation affects the amplitude in the spring-block oscillator problem, showing a good understanding of wave phenomena and energy transfer in oscillatory systems.",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Charge and Electron Calculations": "The student struggles with basic concepts of charge flow and conservation in circuits, as evidenced by the incorrect reasoning about the net charge in a simple circuit setup. This indicates a weak grasp of charge dynamics and fundamental electron behavior in electrical circuits."
