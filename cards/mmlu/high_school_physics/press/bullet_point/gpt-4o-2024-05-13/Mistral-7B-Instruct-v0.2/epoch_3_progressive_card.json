  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student demonstrates a strong grasp of Newton's Laws, particularly in understanding the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. It correctly applies these principles to determine the impossibility of certain accelerations given specific forces and masses, as seen in the question about the resulting acceleration of an object with three external forces. However, it shows a misunderstanding in the application of these laws to the configuration of batteries and resistors in circuits, confusing the effects of series and parallel arrangements on current.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student shows a mixed understanding of electromagnetic theory. It correctly applies Ohm's Law in the context of circuits, understanding the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. However, it incorrectly identifies changes that would always increase current in a circuit, suggesting a lack of depth in understanding the impact of resistance changes in series versus parallel configurations. Additionally, it struggles with the calculation of electric fields and potential differences, as evidenced by the incorrect approach and conclusion in the question about the electric field varying with radius.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Charge and Electron Calculations": "The student correctly understands the conditions under which the net force between two charged particles can be zero, demonstrating a good grasp of the principles governing electrostatic forces. However, it incorrectly concludes that such a scenario is impossible, indicating a misunderstanding or misapplication of Coulomb's Law in practical scenarios."
