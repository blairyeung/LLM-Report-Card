{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student shows a fundamental misunderstanding of Newton's third law and the concept of action-reaction pairs, as evidenced by the incorrect reasoning that the normal force and gravitational force on a person do not form an action-reaction pair because they are not equal in magnitude. This indicates a significant gap in understanding the basic principles of Newton's laws.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "The student demonstrates a lack of understanding in wave phenomena, particularly in the relationship between tension, wave speed, and wavelength in standing waves. It incorrectly asserts that increasing tension leads to a decrease in wavelength, showing a misunderstanding of how these variables interact.",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Charge and Electron Calculations": "",
  "Projectile Motion Analysis": "The student incorrectly calculates the angle for maximum range equaling maximum height in projectile motion, showing a misunderstanding of the kinematic equations and their application to projectile motion. It fails to recognize the correct conditions under which the horizontal and vertical displacements are equal, leading to an incorrect conclusion.",
  "Conservation Laws Application": "It incorrectly applies the conservation of linear momentum in the context of a collision where two carts stick together. The student mistakenly believes that after the collision, each cart has the same linear momentum, rather than understanding that they share a common velocity post-collision. This indicates a misunderstanding of how momentum conservation is applied in inelastic collisions."
