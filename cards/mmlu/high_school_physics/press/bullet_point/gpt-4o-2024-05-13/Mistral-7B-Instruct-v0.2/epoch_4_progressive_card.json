{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student shows a fundamental misunderstanding of Newton's third law in the context of action-reaction force pairs, as evidenced by the incorrect identification of the action-reaction force pair related to a man's weight in an elevator. It incorrectly identifies the force of the man on the scale as the reaction force to the man's weight, overlooking the correct action-reaction pair of the man's weight and the Earth's gravitational pull on the man.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student demonstrates a partial understanding of electromagnetic theory. It correctly identifies the electric field direction and magnitude in the context of an infinitely large charged plane, but struggles with concepts involving electric forces between charged objects, as seen in the incorrect application of Coulomb's law when the mass of one of the charged balls is altered.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "The student shows confusion in applying the first law of thermodynamics to isothermal processes. It incorrectly concludes that it cannot determine whether heat was added or removed from the gas during an isothermal expansion, despite the work done indicating that heat must have been added to maintain constant internal energy.",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Charge and Electron Calculations": "The student struggles with basic calculations involving charge and capacitance. It incorrectly calculates the energy required to charge a capacitor, misunderstanding the relationship between the work done and the energy stored in the capacitor. Additionally, it misinterprets the effects of capacitor configurations in a parallel circuit, incorrectly stating that the charge on each capacitor must differ."
