{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of Newton's laws across various contexts, including kinematics, conservation of momentum, and forces and acceleration. However, it struggles with correctly applying these laws, particularly the third law concerning action-reaction pairs and the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. Misapplications include incorrect identification of action-reaction pairs, misunderstanding of necessary factors for calculations like tension, and errors in predicting outcomes in collision scenarios.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student shows a mixed understanding of electromagnetic theory. It correctly applies basic concepts such as Coulomb's law and Ohm's law but struggles with more complex applications like the behavior of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields, and calculating potential differences using electric field equations. Significant gaps are evident in its grasp of magnetic field effects, electric field dynamics, and the conservation of charge in circuits.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "The student incorrectly interprets the principles of thermodynamics during an isothermal process, mistakenly concluding that heat was removed from the gas when it should have recognized that the heat was added to the gas to perform work. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of how heat transfer and work are related in thermodynamic processes.",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of wave speed fundamentals and the relationship between wave speed, tension, and wavelength. However, it shows weaknesses in applying wave equations to more complex scenarios like projectile motion, incorrectly deriving relationships involving range and maximum vertical displacement.",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Electric Field Calculations": "The student shows partial understanding in electric field calculations, correctly identifying relationships involving surface charge density but struggling with more complex calculations such as the electric field strength in a dipole and the potential difference in varying setups. Errors in integration and setup in calculus-based problems suggest a need for deeper comprehension and careful application of formulas.",
  "Conceptual Understanding of Forces and Motion": "The student struggles with the conceptual understanding of forces and motion, particularly in scenarios involving non-ideal conditions such as air resistance. Misunderstandings include incorrect statements about acceleration and a lack of clarity in the effects of external conditions on motion.",
  "Understanding of Energy Conservation and Work": "The student demonstrates a misunderstanding of the principles of work and energy conservation, particularly evident in problems involving the application of the work-energy theorem, such as stopping a spinning sphere using friction. This shows a fundamental error in applying these principles to solve practical problems.",
  "Gravitational Force Calculations": "The student struggles with the application of gravitational force calculations, incorrectly concluding that gravitational acceleration remains unchanged with variations in mass and radius of a planet. This indicates a critical misunderstanding of how gravitational forces are influenced by these factors.",
  "Problem Solving Strategy": "The student consistently uses a step-by-step approach to solve physics problems, which is a good strategy. However, it sometimes reaches incorrect conclusions due to misinterpretations or miscalculations within these steps. This suggests that while the approach is systematic, it needs refinement in execution and verification of each step."
