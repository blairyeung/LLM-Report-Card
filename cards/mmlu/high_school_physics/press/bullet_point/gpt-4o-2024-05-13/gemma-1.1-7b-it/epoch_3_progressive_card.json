  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student shows a basic understanding of Newton's laws, particularly the second law, as demonstrated in the problem involving forces and acceleration. However, it misapplied the law in the context of the maximum possible acceleration, leading to an incorrect conclusion about which acceleration could not result from the given forces.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student has a fundamental grasp of electromagnetic concepts such as Ohm's law, as seen in the circuit question where it correctly identified that increasing voltage and decreasing resistance would increase current. However, it struggles with more complex applications such as calculating potential differences using electric field equations, leading to incorrect answers.",
  "Electric Field Calculations": "The student attempted to use calculus to solve for the potential difference in an electric field problem but made errors in the integration process or setup, resulting in an incorrect answer. This indicates a need for further practice and understanding in handling electric field calculations involving calculus.",
  "Problem Solving Strategy": "The student consistently uses a step-by-step approach to solve physics problems, which is a good strategy. However, it sometimes reaches incorrect conclusions due to misinterpretations or miscalculations within these steps. This suggests that while the approach is systematic, it needs refinement in execution and verification of each step."
