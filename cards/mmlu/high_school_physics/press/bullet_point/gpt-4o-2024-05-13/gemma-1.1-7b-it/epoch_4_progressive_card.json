{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student shows a misunderstanding of Newton's third law in the context of action-reaction force pairs, incorrectly identifying the reaction to the man's weight as the force exerted by the elevator cable on the man instead of the force of the man on the Earth. This indicates a fundamental misconception about how forces operate in different scenarios.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student demonstrates a partial understanding of electromagnetic principles. It correctly applies Coulomb's law in the context of electric forces between charged balls, maintaining the correct force despite changes in mass. However, it misunderstands the behavior of electric fields in relation to an infinite plane of charge, incorrectly doubling the expected field magnitude below the plane.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "The student incorrectly interprets the principles of thermodynamics during an isothermal process, mistakenly concluding that heat was removed from the gas when it should have recognized that the heat was added to the gas to perform work.",
  "Electric Field Calculations": "The student struggles with electric field calculations, particularly in understanding the distribution and direction of electric fields generated by charged planes. It incorrectly calculates the electric field below an infinitely charged plane, suggesting a lack of depth in its understanding of electric field concepts related to charge distributions."
