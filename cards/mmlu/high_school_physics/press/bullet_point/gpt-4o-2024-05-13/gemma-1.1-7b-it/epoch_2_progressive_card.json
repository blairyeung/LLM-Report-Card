  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student shows a mixed understanding of Newton's laws. In the elevator question, it correctly identifies the need for mass and acceleration to calculate tension but incorrectly includes velocity as a necessary factor. In the toy car and truck collision, it fails to correctly apply Newton's third law and the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, leading to an incorrect conclusion about the relative accelerations of the two objects.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of electromagnetic principles. In the circuit question, it incorrectly assumes that the net charge of the circuit elements changes due to the flow of electrons, which contradicts the conservation of charge. This indicates a significant gap in understanding basic electromagnetic theory.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Electric Field Calculations": "",
  "Gravitational Force Calculations": "The student struggles with the application of gravitational force calculations. In the astronaut weight question, it incorrectly concludes that the gravitational acceleration remains unchanged when the mass and radius of a planet are doubled, leading to an incorrect answer. This shows a critical misunderstanding of how gravitational force is influenced by changes in mass and radius."
