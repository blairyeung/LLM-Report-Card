{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of Newton's laws, particularly the second law, as seen in the problem involving forces acting on an object. However, it incorrectly applies the concept to determine the possible resulting accelerations, showing a misunderstanding of how forces can be vectorially added and how they affect acceleration.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student shows a reasonable grasp of basic circuit concepts, particularly Ohm's Law, but struggles with more complex scenarios involving changes in voltage and resistance. It incorrectly identifies the configuration that would result in the greatest current, indicating a lack of deep understanding of how voltage and resistance interplay in circuits.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Problem Solving and Calculation Accuracy": "The student often attempts to solve problems using step-by-step breakdowns, which is a good approach, but frequently makes calculation errors or logical mistakes in the process. For example, in the optics problem, it miscalculates the focal length of a diverging mirror and in the electric field problem, it incorrectly calculates the potential difference, showing a lack of precision in handling equations and integrating concepts."
