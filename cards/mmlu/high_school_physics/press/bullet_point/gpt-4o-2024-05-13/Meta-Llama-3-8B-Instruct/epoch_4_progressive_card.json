{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student demonstrates a strong grasp of Newton's laws, particularly in understanding action-reaction pairs and the effects of forces in different scenarios. However, it struggles with the application of these principles in rotational dynamics, as seen in the misunderstanding of angular momentum conservation in a system.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student shows a solid understanding of electromagnetic theory, correctly applying Coulomb's law and concepts of electric fields in various configurations. However, it incorrectly assessed the effect of mass on electric force, indicating a potential confusion between gravitational and electric forces.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "The student accurately applies the principles of thermodynamics, correctly identifying the relationship between heat transfer and work done during isothermal processes.",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Gravitational Force Calculations": "The student struggles with the application of gravitational force calculations over varying distances, as evidenced by the incorrect estimation of weight change at different altitudes. It fails to correctly apply the inverse square law of gravitation, leading to significant errors in understanding how gravitational force changes with distance."
