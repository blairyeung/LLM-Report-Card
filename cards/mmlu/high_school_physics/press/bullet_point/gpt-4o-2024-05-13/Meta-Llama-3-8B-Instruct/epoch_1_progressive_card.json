{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of Newton's third law, confusing action-reaction pairs with forces that are equal in magnitude but do not form an action-reaction pair. This indicates a significant gap in understanding the basic principles of Newtonian mechanics.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "The student incorrectly applies the relationship between wave speed, tension, and wavelength, leading to a misunderstanding of how these variables interact in the context of standing waves. This suggests a weak grasp of wave phenomena, particularly in understanding the direct and inverse relationships involved in wave mechanics.",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Projectile Motion Analysis": "The student struggles with the analysis of projectile motion, particularly in applying trigonometric identities and understanding the relationship between range and maximum height. This indicates a lack of proficiency in solving problems that involve the kinematics of projectile motion."
