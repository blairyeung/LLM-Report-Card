{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student demonstrates a strong grasp of Newton's Laws, particularly in applying the second law to analyze the motion of particles in electric fields and the kinematics of accelerating bodies. It correctly applies the formulas and principles to solve problems involving forces and motion, such as the charged particle in an electric field and the car's acceleration scenario.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student shows a comprehensive understanding of electromagnetic theory. It correctly applies the Lorentz force law and Gauss's Law in contexts involving magnetic fields in solenoids and electric fields around charged conductors. It accurately describes the behavior of protons in magnetic fields and the electric field near charged surfaces, indicating a deep understanding of how electric and magnetic fields interact with matter.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "The student adeptly handles problems related to wave phenomena, particularly sound waves. It correctly identifies that the speed of sound in a medium is independent of the frequency of the sound wave, demonstrating a clear understanding of the relationship between wave speed, frequency, and wavelength.",
