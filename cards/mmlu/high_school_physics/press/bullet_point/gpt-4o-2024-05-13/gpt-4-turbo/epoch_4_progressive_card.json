{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student demonstrates a strong grasp of Newton's laws, particularly the third law of motion, as evidenced by the accurate explanation of action-reaction force pairs in the elevator scenario. It correctly identifies the force of the man on the Earth and the Earth's force on the man as the action-reaction pair, showing a clear understanding of how these forces interact.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student shows a proficient understanding of electromagnetic theory, correctly applying Coulomb's Law to determine that the electric force remains unchanged despite the doubling of one ball's mass, as the charges and distance between them do not change. Additionally, it accurately describes the behavior of the electric field around an infinitely large charged plane using Gauss's Law, indicating a solid comprehension of electric field concepts.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "It adeptly applies the first law of thermodynamics to an isothermal process, correctly concluding that the heat added to the gas equals the work done by the gas, due to the constant internal energy in such a scenario. This demonstrates a strong ability to link thermodynamic principles to practical examples.",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "",
