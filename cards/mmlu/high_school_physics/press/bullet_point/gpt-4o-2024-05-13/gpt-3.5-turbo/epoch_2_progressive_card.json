{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student shows a mixed understanding of Newton's laws. It correctly applies Newton's third law in the context of a collision between a toy car and truck, but misunderstands the implications of mass on acceleration, leading to an incorrect conclusion. In another instance, it correctly identifies the need for mass and acceleration to determine tension in an elevator cable, demonstrating a partial grasp of Newtonian mechanics.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of electromagnetic theory. It correctly identifies that the net charge in a circuit does not change after a light bulb is lit. However, it incorrectly calculates the radius of a circular path for a charged particle in a magnetic field, showing a misunderstanding of the relationship between mass, charge, and magnetic field influence on the path radius.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Electric Field Calculations": "",
  "Problem Solving and Calculation Accuracy": "The student often correctly identifies the relevant physics principles needed to solve problems but struggles with the execution of calculations and logical reasoning in some cases. For example, it miscalculates the gravitational force on a planet with twice the mass and radius of Earth, leading to an incorrect answer. It also misapplies concepts in calculating the effect of mass on the amplitude of oscillations in a spring-block system."
