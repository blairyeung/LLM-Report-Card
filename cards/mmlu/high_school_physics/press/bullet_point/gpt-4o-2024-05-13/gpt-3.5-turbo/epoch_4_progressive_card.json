{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student shows a mixed understanding of Newton's laws. It correctly applies the concept of action-reaction pairs in some scenarios but fails in others, such as misunderstanding the action-reaction pair related to a man's weight in an elevator. This indicates a partial grasp of Newton's third law.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of electromagnetic theory, correctly explaining the behavior of capacitors in a circuit and accurately calculating the electric force between charged objects. It also correctly identifies the direction and magnitude of electric fields in different configurations.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "The student correctly understands the principles of thermodynamics, particularly in the context of isothermal processes. It accurately describes the relationship between work done and heat transfer in such a scenario.",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Electric Field Calculations": "The student shows proficiency in electric field calculations, correctly applying Gauss's law and understanding the effects of geometric configurations on electric fields. It accurately calculates and explains the electric field behavior in the context of charged planes."
