{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student shows a mixed understanding of Newton's laws. In the question about the object acted upon by three forces, it incorrectly calculated the resulting acceleration, misunderstanding the application of Newton's second law. However, in the projectile motion question, it correctly identified the behavior of vertical speed, demonstrating a correct application of the laws in that context.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student demonstrates a strong grasp of electromagnetic theory, correctly solving the question about the electric field and potential difference using integration of the electric field. However, it shows a misunderstanding in the question about the configuration of battery and resistors, incorrectly identifying the configuration that would create the greatest current.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Electric Field Calculations": "The student correctly applied the concept of electric field calculations in determining the potential difference between two points in an electric field, showing a good understanding of how to integrate the electric field over a distance to find voltage differences.",
  "Mirror and Lens Formula Application": "The student incorrectly applied the mirror formula for a diverging mirror, misunderstanding the sign convention for object and image distances, which led to an incorrect calculation of the focal length."
