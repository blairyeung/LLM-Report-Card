{
  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student shows a strong grasp of Newton's laws in scenarios involving basic mechanics, such as the analysis of forces acting on a person standing on a floor and the conservation of momentum in a collision. However, it misunderstands the nature of action-reaction pairs, incorrectly identifying the normal force and gravitational force as such a pair, indicating a conceptual gap.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of wave phenomena, particularly in the context of standing waves on a string. It correctly relates changes in tension to changes in wave speed and wavelength, showing a good grasp of the relationship between physical properties and wave behavior. However, it struggles with projectile motion, incorrectly deriving and applying the relationship between angles and displacement.",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Electric Field Calculations": "",
  "Projectile Motion Analysis": "The student struggles with the analysis of projectile motion, particularly in understanding the relationship between launch angles and displacement characteristics. It incorrectly derives the relationship between the angle and the range and vertical displacement, showing a misunderstanding of the trigonometric application in projectile motion."
