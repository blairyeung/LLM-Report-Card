  "Newton's Laws Mastery": "The student shows a misunderstanding of Newton's third law in the context of action-reaction pairs, as evidenced by the incorrect identification of the reaction force to the man's weight in the elevator scenario. It incorrectly identifies the force of the man on the scale as the reaction force, instead of the force of the man on the Earth. This indicates a fundamental misconception or confusion about how action-reaction pairs are identified and applied in real-world scenarios.",
  "Electromagnetic Theory Understanding": "The student demonstrates a strong grasp of electromagnetic theory, correctly applying Coulomb's Law and concepts of electric fields in various scenarios. It accurately describes the electric force between two charged balls and the behavior of the electric field around an infinitely large charged plane, showing a correct understanding of the direction and magnitude of electric fields.",
  "Thermodynamics Principles Application": "The student correctly applies the first law of thermodynamics to an isothermal process, demonstrating a clear understanding of the relationship between heat transfer and work done by the system. It accurately calculates the heat added to the gas during an isothermal expansion, showing a solid grasp of energy conservation principles in thermodynamic processes.",
  "Wave Phenomena Analysis": "",
  "Quantum Mechanics Concepts": "",
  "Electric Field Calculations": "The student accurately calculates and understands the behavior of electric fields in different configurations. It correctly identifies the magnitude and direction of the electric field both above and below an infinitely large charged plane, demonstrating a strong ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical situations involving electric fields."
