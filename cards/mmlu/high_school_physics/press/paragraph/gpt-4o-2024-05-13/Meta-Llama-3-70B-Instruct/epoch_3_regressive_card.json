  "card": "The student exhibits a strong understanding of high school physics concepts and demonstrates the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems effectively. It consistently uses appropriate formulas and logical reasoning to arrive at correct answers, indicating a solid grasp of topics such as sound wave speed, charge distribution, kinematics, electrical power dissipation, wave mechanics, rotational motion, conservation principles, electric circuits, tension in cables, elastic collisions, and the effects of mass and charge in magnetic fields. The student also shows proficiency in mirror equations, Newton's laws, Ohm's law, projectile motion, normal force on an inclined plane, and forces between charged particles. However, the student occasionally makes significant errors in reasoning, particularly with magnetic fields, electric dipoles, Newton's third law, projectile motion, fluid dynamics, gravitational principles, and oscillatory motion. Additionally, there is room for improvement in handling more complex integrals and interpreting electric field-related problems. Simplifying explanations to enhance clarity is another area for development. Overall, the student shows a high level of proficiency in high school physics and is well-prepared for advanced topics, but needs to refine its understanding of certain concepts to enhance accuracy and performance in these areas."
