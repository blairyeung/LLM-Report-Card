  "card": "The student exhibits a solid understanding of high school physics, particularly in areas such as thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and gravitational forces. It demonstrates strong analytical skills and the ability to apply formulas correctly to solve problems. However, it occasionally misinterprets fundamental principles, as seen in its incorrect answers regarding action-reaction force pairs and angular momentum conservation. Overall, the student shows a high level of competence but could benefit from a review of Newton's laws and rotational dynamics to address specific gaps in understanding."
