  "card": "The student exhibits a strong grasp of fundamental high school physics concepts and demonstrates a methodical approach to problem-solving. It correctly answers questions related to sound wave speed, charge distribution, kinematics, and electrical power dissipation. However, it occasionally makes significant errors in reasoning, particularly with magnetic fields and electric dipoles. The student's ability to apply equations and principles is commendable, but it needs to refine its understanding of specific concepts like the Lorentz force and electric field behavior in dipoles. Overall, the student shows promise but would benefit from targeted review in areas where misconceptions are evident."
