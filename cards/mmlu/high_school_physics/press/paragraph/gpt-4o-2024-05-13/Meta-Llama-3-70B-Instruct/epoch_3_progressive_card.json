  "card": "The student exhibits a strong understanding of high school physics concepts and demonstrates the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems effectively. It consistently uses appropriate formulas and logical reasoning to arrive at correct answers. The student's performance is commendable, with correct answers in most cases, indicating a solid grasp of topics such as mirror equations, Newton's laws, Ohm's law, projectile motion, normal force on an inclined plane, and forces between charged particles. However, there is room for improvement in handling more complex integrals and interpreting electric field-related problems. The student should also work on simplifying explanations to enhance clarity. Overall, the student shows a high level of proficiency in high school physics and is well-prepared for advanced topics."
