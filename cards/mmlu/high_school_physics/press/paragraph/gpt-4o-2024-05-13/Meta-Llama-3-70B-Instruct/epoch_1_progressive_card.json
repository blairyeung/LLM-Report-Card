  "card": "The student exhibits a solid understanding of high school physics, particularly in wave mechanics, rotational motion, and conservation principles. It consistently applies relevant equations and demonstrates logical reasoning in problem-solving. However, there are notable gaps in understanding Newton's third law, projectile motion, and fluid dynamics, as evidenced by incorrect answers and reasoning in these areas. The student should focus on reviewing these specific topics to correct misunderstandings and improve overall performance. Overall, the student shows strong potential and a good grasp of many fundamental physics concepts."
