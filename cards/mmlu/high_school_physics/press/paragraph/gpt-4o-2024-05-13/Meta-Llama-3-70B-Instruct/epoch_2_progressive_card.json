  "card": "The student exhibits a solid understanding of certain high school physics concepts, such as electric circuits, tension in cables, elastic collisions, and the effects of mass and charge in magnetic fields. It demonstrates a methodical approach to problem-solving, often breaking down problems into smaller, manageable parts. However, the student struggles with applying gravitational principles correctly, as seen in the miscalculation of an astronaut's weight on a different planet and the misunderstanding of vertical acceleration on an incline. Additionally, the student incorrectly assessed the effect of mass on the amplitude of oscillations in a spring-block system. Overall, the student shows promise but needs to refine its understanding of gravitational and oscillatory motion to improve accuracy in these areas."
