  "card": "The student exhibits a strong conceptual understanding and reasoning ability in high school physics. It consistently provides correct answers with thorough explanations, demonstrating a solid grasp of electromagnetism, wave properties, charge quantization, electric fields, kinematics, and circuit analysis. The student's ability to break down problems and apply relevant equations is commendable. However, there is room for improvement in handling more complex problems, as evidenced by an incorrect response involving changes in velocity and mass. Overall, the student shows excellent proficiency in high school physics with minor areas for refinement.The student demonstrates a strong willingness to engage with high school physics problems and often provides detailed step-by-step reasoning. However, the student's conceptual understanding is inconsistent, leading to several incorrect answers. The student shows a good grasp of angular momentum and torque but struggles with understanding wave mechanics, Newton's third law, projectile motion, fluid dynamics, and harmonic motion. The student's reasoning is thorough but sometimes includes fundamental errors or misconceptions. Overall, the student needs to strengthen its conceptual understanding and ensure that its detailed reasoning aligns with correct physical principles."
