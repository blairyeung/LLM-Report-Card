  "card": "The student exhibits a methodical approach to solving physics problems, often breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps. It shows a good grasp of basic formulas and principles but struggles with applying these concepts correctly in more complex scenarios. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of kinetic energy and Newton's laws but has notable gaps in understanding gravitational forces, charge conservation, and energy conservation in oscillatory systems. The student needs to work on correctly interpreting and applying physical principles to avoid conceptual errors. Overall, the student shows potential but requires further practice and clarification of fundamental concepts to improve accuracy and deepen understanding in high school physics."
