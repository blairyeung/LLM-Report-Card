  "card": "The student demonstrates a strong willingness to engage with high school physics problems and often provides detailed step-by-step reasoning. It shows a good grasp of fundamental physics concepts, including Newton's laws, thermodynamics, and electrostatics, and is proficient in applying formulas and performing calculations. The student exhibits a methodical approach to solving physics problems, breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps. However, it struggles with applying these concepts accurately in more complex scenarios and often makes calculation errors and logical missteps. The student needs to strengthen its conceptual understanding in areas such as wave mechanics, Newton's third law, projectile motion, fluid dynamics, harmonic motion, gravitational forces, charge conservation, and energy conservation in oscillatory systems. With more practice and attention to detail, the student has the potential to significantly improve its performance in high school physics."
