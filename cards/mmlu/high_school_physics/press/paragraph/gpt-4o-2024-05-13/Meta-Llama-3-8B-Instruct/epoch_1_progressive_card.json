  "card": "The student demonstrates a strong willingness to engage with high school physics problems and often provides detailed step-by-step reasoning. However, the student's conceptual understanding is inconsistent, leading to several incorrect answers. The student shows a good grasp of angular momentum and torque but struggles with understanding wave mechanics, Newton's third law, projectile motion, fluid dynamics, and harmonic motion. The student's reasoning is thorough but sometimes includes fundamental errors or misconceptions. Overall, the student needs to strengthen its conceptual understanding and ensure that its detailed reasoning aligns with correct physical principles."
