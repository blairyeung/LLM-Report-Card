  "card": "The student shows a good grasp of fundamental physics concepts but struggles with applying these concepts accurately in problem-solving scenarios. It demonstrates a methodical approach to breaking down problems and identifying relevant principles, which is a strength. However, it often makes calculation errors and logical missteps that lead to incorrect answers. The student needs to focus on improving its calculation accuracy and ensuring that its reasoning aligns with the physical principles involved. With more practice and attention to detail, the student has the potential to significantly improve its performance in high school physics."
