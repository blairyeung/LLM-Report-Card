  "card": "The student shows a good understanding of basic high school physics concepts but struggles with more complex applications. It often provides detailed reasoning, indicating a strong grasp of fundamental principles. However, there are notable errors in the application of these principles, particularly in problems involving multiple steps or more complex scenarios. The student excels in questions involving straightforward applications of Newton's laws and charge conservation but needs to improve in areas requiring more intricate problem-solving and multi-step calculations. Overall, the student has a solid foundation but would benefit from additional practice with complex problems to enhance its problem-solving skills and accuracy."
