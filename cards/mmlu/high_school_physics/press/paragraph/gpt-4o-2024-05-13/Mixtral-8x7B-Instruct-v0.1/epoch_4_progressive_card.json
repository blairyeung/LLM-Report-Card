  "card": "The student demonstrates a moderate understanding of high school physics concepts, with strengths in thermodynamics and gravitational force calculations. It shows a good ability to apply formulas and principles in certain contexts, such as Coulomb's law and the first law of thermodynamics. However, the student struggles with correctly identifying action-reaction pairs and understanding the conservation of angular momentum. Additionally, there are occasional arithmetic errors and misunderstandings in electric field direction and magnitude. The student would benefit from further practice and review in these areas to solidify its understanding and improve accuracy in problem-solving."
