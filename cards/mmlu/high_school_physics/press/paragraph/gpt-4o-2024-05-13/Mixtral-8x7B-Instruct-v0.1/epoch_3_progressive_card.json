  "card": "The student exhibits a solid understanding of high school physics, particularly in optics and mechanics. It consistently applies relevant formulas and demonstrates logical reasoning in problem-solving. However, there are areas for improvement, especially in understanding the nuances of electric fields and forces between charged particles. The student should focus on refining its approach to these topics and ensuring that its calculations and conceptual interpretations are accurate. Overall, the student shows promise and a good foundation in physics, with room for further development in specific areas."
