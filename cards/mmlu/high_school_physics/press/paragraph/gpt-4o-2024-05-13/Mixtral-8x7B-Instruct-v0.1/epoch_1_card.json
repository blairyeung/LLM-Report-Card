  "card": "The student exhibits a strong grasp of high school physics concepts, consistently providing correct answers and thorough explanations. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the behavior of charged particles in magnetic fields, the properties of sound waves, and the relationship between charge and electric field. The student's reasoning is methodical and shows a solid foundation in fundamental principles. However, there is a minor calculation error in the dipole problem, indicating a need for careful verification of calculations. Overall, the student performs exceptionally well in this topic, demonstrating both conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills.The student shows a moderate understanding of high school physics concepts but struggles with applying these concepts correctly in various scenarios. It demonstrates a good grasp of oscillatory motion and momentum conservation but has notable weaknesses in wave mechanics, Newton's laws, projectile motion, and fluid dynamics. The student often misinterprets the relationships between physical quantities and makes calculation errors. It would benefit from a more thorough review of fundamental principles and practice in applying these principles to different types of problems."
