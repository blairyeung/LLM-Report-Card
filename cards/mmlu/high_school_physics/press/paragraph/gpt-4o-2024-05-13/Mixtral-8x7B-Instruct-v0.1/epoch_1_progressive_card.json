  "card": "The student shows a moderate understanding of high school physics concepts but struggles with applying these concepts correctly in various scenarios. It demonstrates a good grasp of oscillatory motion and momentum conservation but has notable weaknesses in wave mechanics, Newton's laws, projectile motion, and fluid dynamics. The student often misinterprets the relationships between physical quantities and makes calculation errors. It would benefit from a more thorough review of fundamental principles and practice in applying these principles to different types of problems."
