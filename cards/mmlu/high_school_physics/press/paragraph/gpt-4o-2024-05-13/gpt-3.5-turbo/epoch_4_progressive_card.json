  "card": "The student shows a moderate level of understanding in high school physics, with strengths in thermodynamics and circuit theory. It demonstrates the ability to correctly apply principles of isothermal processes and parallel capacitors. However, the student has notable gaps in understanding Newton's third law, electrostatics, and energy concepts, as evidenced by incorrect answers and flawed reasoning in those areas. The student also needs to improve their understanding of angular momentum and the effects of mass on electric force. Overall, the student has a good foundation but needs to address specific conceptual weaknesses to improve their performance in high school physics."
