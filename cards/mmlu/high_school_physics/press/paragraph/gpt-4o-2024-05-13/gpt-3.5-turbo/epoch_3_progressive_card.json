  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of some high school physics concepts, particularly in areas like projectile motion and Ohm's Law. It demonstrates the ability to apply formulas and reason through problems logically. However, there are areas where the student needs improvement, such as correctly applying the mirror formula and understanding the conditions for electrostatic equilibrium. The student should focus on refining its calculation skills and ensuring a thorough understanding of the underlying principles to avoid misinterpretations. Overall, the student shows potential but requires more practice and attention to detail to achieve consistent accuracy in its responses."
