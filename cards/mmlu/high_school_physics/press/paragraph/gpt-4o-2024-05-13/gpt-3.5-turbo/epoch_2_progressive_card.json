  "card": "The student has a foundational understanding of high school physics but exhibits inconsistencies in applying concepts to solve problems. It is proficient in basic mechanics and electric circuits, as evidenced by correct answers and sound reasoning in those areas. However, the student struggles with more complex topics such as gravitational forces on different planets, elastic collisions, and oscillatory motion. It often uses correct formulas but makes errors in their application or in the logical steps of problem-solving. The student would benefit from targeted practice in dynamics and oscillatory systems, as well as a review of the principles of conservation of momentum and energy. Overall, the student shows potential but needs to refine its problem-solving techniques and conceptual understanding in specific areas."
