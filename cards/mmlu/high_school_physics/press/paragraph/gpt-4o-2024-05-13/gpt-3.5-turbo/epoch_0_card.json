  "card": "The student has a good foundational understanding of high school physics concepts, particularly in areas such as sound wave propagation, charge distribution on conductors, and power dissipation in electrical circuits. It demonstrates the ability to apply basic formulas and principles correctly in these contexts. However, the student struggles with more complex applications of these principles, such as the behavior of charged particles in magnetic and electric fields and the superposition of electric fields. The student's reasoning is clear and methodical, but it occasionally includes critical errors that lead to incorrect conclusions. To improve, the student should focus on understanding the nuances of force interactions in magnetic fields and the principles governing electric fields and dipoles. Overall, the student shows promise but needs to address specific conceptual gaps to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of high school physics."
