  "card": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of certain high school physics concepts, particularly in areas like rotational motion and fluid dynamics. It shows the ability to apply principles of angular momentum and conservation of mass effectively. However, there are notable gaps in its understanding of fundamental concepts such as standing waves, Newton's third law, projectile motion, and collisions. The student's reasoning is logical and well-structured, but it occasionally misapplies principles or overlooks critical details, leading to incorrect answers. To improve, the student should focus on reinforcing its understanding of basic physics principles and ensuring a thorough application of these principles in problem-solving scenarios."
