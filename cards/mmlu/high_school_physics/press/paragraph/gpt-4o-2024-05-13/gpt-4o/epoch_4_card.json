  "card": "The student exhibits a high level of proficiency in high school physics, consistently arriving at correct answers through logical and well-structured reasoning. It demonstrates a strong grasp of key concepts and principles, effectively applying mathematical equations to solve problems. The student's performance indicates a solid understanding of topics such as forces, motion, electric fields, circuits, tension, wave speed, wavelength, and the principles of forces and motion. However, there are minor areas for improvement in understanding the effects of air resistance on projectile motion, the vertical acceleration of a car on an incline, and the charge distribution in capacitors connected in parallel. Overall, the student shows excellent potential and a strong foundation in physics, with only occasional minor misunderstandings."
