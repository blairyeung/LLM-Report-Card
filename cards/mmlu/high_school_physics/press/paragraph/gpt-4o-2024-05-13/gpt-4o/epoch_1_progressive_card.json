  "card": "The student exhibits a strong grasp of high school physics concepts, consistently providing correct answers and detailed, logical explanations. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the relationships between physical quantities, such as tension, wave speed, and wavelength, as well as the principles of forces and motion. The student effectively applies mathematical formulas and principles, such as conservation of mass and energy, to solve problems. However, there is a minor gap in understanding the effects of air resistance on projectile motion, specifically regarding the acceleration at the highest point. Overall, the student shows a high level of proficiency in high school physics, with only a few areas needing slight improvement."
