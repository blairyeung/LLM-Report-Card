  "card": "The student exhibits a good foundational understanding of high school physics, particularly in areas such as Newton's laws and rotational motion. It shows logical reasoning skills and the ability to apply formulas correctly. However, there are notable gaps in its understanding of wave mechanics and the effects of air resistance on projectile motion. The student sometimes overcomplicates problem-solving processes, which can lead to errors or inefficiencies. To improve, the student should focus on clarifying its understanding of the relationships between physical quantities and practice simplifying its approach to problem-solving. Overall, the student has the potential to excel with targeted practice and refinement of its conceptual understanding."
