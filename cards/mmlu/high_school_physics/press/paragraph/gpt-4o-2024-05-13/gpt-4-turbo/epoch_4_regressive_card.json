  "card": "The student exhibits a high level of proficiency in high school physics. It consistently provides correct answers and supports them with well-reasoned explanations. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of key physics principles, including Newton's laws, rotational motion, the motion of charged particles in magnetic fields, the speed of sound waves in air, electric fields and forces, gravitational forces, electric circuits, Newtonian mechanics, conservation laws, optics, mechanics, electricity, and electromagnetism. It effectively applies these principles to solve problems and explain physical phenomena. The student's ability to articulate their reasoning clearly and accurately indicates a deep comprehension of the subject matter. However, there are minor gaps in understanding wave mechanics, the effects of air resistance on projectile motion, and the effects of different circuit configurations on current. Additionally, the student sometimes overcomplicates problem-solving processes, which can lead to errors or inefficiencies. Overall, the student shows strong analytical skills and a thorough grasp of high school physics concepts, with only a few areas needing slight improvement."
