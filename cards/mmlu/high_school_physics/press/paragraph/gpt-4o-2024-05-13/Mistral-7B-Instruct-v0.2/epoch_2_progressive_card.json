  "card": "The student shows a moderate understanding of high school physics concepts but has notable gaps in applying these concepts correctly. It demonstrates a good grasp of some fundamental principles, such as the relationship between mass, charge, and magnetic field in determining the radius of a circular path. However, it struggles with more complex applications, such as gravitational effects on weight and conservation of charge in circuits. The student's reasoning often includes correct elements but lacks precision and sometimes leads to incorrect conclusions. It would benefit from focusing on the correct application of formulas and principles, as well as improving its ability to interpret and solve multi-step problems accurately."
