  "card": "The student demonstrates a need for improvement in high school physics, particularly in understanding fundamental concepts and applying them correctly. The student's answers often include detailed reasoning, but this reasoning frequently contains critical errors or misconceptions. The student shows some understanding of the continuity equation in fluid dynamics but struggles with concepts related to wave mechanics, Newton's laws, projectile motion, and gravitational forces. The student would benefit from targeted practice in these areas and a focus on simplifying problem-solving strategies to avoid overcomplicating solutions. Overall, the student has the potential to improve with focused study and practice on core physics principles."
