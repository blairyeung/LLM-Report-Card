  "card": "The student shows a moderate understanding of high school physics, with strengths in certain areas such as electromagnetism and electric fields. It correctly identifies the behavior of a proton in a solenoid and the electric field near a charged conductor. However, it has notable weaknesses in areas like wave mechanics, charge quantification, and kinematics. The student's approach to problem-solving is often overly complex and prone to calculation errors, indicating a need for improved conceptual clarity and more practice with fundamental principles. Overall, the student has potential but requires targeted support to address specific gaps in knowledge and enhance problem-solving skills."
