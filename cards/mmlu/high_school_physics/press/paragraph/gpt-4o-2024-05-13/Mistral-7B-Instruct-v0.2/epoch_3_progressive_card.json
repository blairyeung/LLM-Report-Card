  "card": "The student shows a strong ability to articulate their reasoning and perform detailed calculations, which is a positive indicator of their problem-solving skills. However, there are notable gaps in their conceptual understanding of certain high school physics topics, such as the mirror equation, electric field potential difference, and normal force on an inclined plane. The student correctly answered questions related to Newton's second law, projectile motion, and circuit current, indicating a good grasp of these areas. To improve, the student should focus on reviewing the fundamental principles and correct application of formulas in the areas where they made errors. Overall, the student demonstrates potential but needs to address specific conceptual weaknesses to achieve a more consistent performance in high school physics."
