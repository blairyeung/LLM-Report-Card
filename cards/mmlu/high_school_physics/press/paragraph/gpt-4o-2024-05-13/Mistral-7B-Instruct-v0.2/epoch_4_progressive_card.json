  "card": "The student demonstrates a moderate understanding of high school physics concepts but exhibits several critical misconceptions. It shows a good grasp of electric fields and symmetry in charge distributions but struggles with applying Newton's laws and the principles of thermodynamics. The student often overcomplicates problems and sometimes fails to identify the correct physical principles to apply. It would benefit from focusing on fundamental concepts and practicing problem-solving strategies to improve accuracy and conceptual clarity."
