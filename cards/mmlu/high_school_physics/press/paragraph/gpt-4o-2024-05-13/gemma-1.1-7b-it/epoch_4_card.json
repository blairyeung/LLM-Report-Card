  "card": "The student exhibits a solid understanding of certain high school physics concepts, particularly in wave mechanics, electrostatics, and circuit theory. It correctly applies relevant formulas and principles in these areas, demonstrating a good grasp of the relationship between tension and wavelength, and the energy stored in capacitors. However, the student struggles with applying concepts related to magnetic forces on charged particles, electric fields in dipoles, and kinematic equations. There are also notable gaps in understanding Newton's third law, projectile motion, fluid dynamics, gravitational force calculations, net charge conservation, and the dynamics of collisions and oscillations. The student's reasoning is logical and structured, but there are significant gaps in conceptual understanding and application, leading to incorrect conclusions. Continued practice and targeted review of these areas will help the student strengthen its overall grasp of high school physics concepts and improve its problem-solving skills."
