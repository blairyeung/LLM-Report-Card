  "card": "The student shows a good understanding of basic principles in wave mechanics, electrostatics, and circuit theory, as evidenced by correct answers on related questions. However, the student struggles with applying concepts related to magnetic forces on charged particles, electric fields in dipoles, and kinematic equations. The student tends to make errors in calculations and conceptual applications in these areas. To improve, the student should focus on practicing problems involving the motion of charged particles in magnetic fields, understanding electric field distributions in dipoles, and correctly applying kinematic equations to uniformly accelerating objects.The student shows a solid understanding of wave mechanics and the relationship between tension and wavelength, correctly applying relevant formulas and principles. However, the student struggles with correctly applying Newton's third law, projectile motion, and fluid dynamics concepts. The student's reasoning is logical and structured, but there are significant gaps in conceptual understanding and application, leading to incorrect conclusions. The student would benefit from a deeper review of Newton's laws, projectile motion, and fluid dynamics to strengthen their overall grasp of high school physics concepts."
