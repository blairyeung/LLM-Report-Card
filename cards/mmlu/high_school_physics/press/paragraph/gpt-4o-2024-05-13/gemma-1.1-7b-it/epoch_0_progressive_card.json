  "card": "The student shows a good understanding of basic principles in wave mechanics, electrostatics, and circuit theory, as evidenced by correct answers on related questions. However, the student struggles with applying concepts related to magnetic forces on charged particles, electric fields in dipoles, and kinematic equations. The student tends to make errors in calculations and conceptual applications in these areas. To improve, the student should focus on practicing problems involving the motion of charged particles in magnetic fields, understanding electric field distributions in dipoles, and correctly applying kinematic equations to uniformly accelerating objects."
