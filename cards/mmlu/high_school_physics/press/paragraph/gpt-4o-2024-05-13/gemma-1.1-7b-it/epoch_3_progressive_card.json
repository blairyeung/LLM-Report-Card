  "card": "The student exhibits a basic understanding of some high school physics concepts but struggles with applying formulas and principles correctly in various contexts. It demonstrates a good grasp of projectile motion and the effect of gravity on vertical speed. However, it needs to improve its understanding of the mirror formula, Newton's second law, Ohm's law, electric potential difference, and circuit behavior. The student often makes calculation errors and misinterprets the conditions for physical phenomena, such as the normal force on an inclined plane and the net force between charged particles. To improve, the student should focus on practicing problem-solving techniques and reinforcing its conceptual understanding of physics principles."
