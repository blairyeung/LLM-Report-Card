  "card": "The student exhibits a solid understanding of certain high school physics concepts, particularly in areas involving direct application of formulas, such as calculating the energy stored in capacitors and understanding electric forces. However, there are notable gaps in the student's conceptual understanding, especially regarding fundamental principles like Newton's third law and the behavior of gases during isothermal processes. The student tends to follow logical steps and use correct formulas but sometimes arrives at incorrect conclusions, indicating a need for deeper comprehension and better application of theoretical knowledge to practical problems. Overall, the student shows potential but would benefit from targeted review and practice in areas where conceptual misunderstandings are evident."
