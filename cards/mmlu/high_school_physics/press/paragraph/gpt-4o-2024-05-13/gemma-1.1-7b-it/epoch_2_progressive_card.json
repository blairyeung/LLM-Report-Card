  "card": "The student demonstrates a foundational understanding of high school physics concepts but struggles with the application and integration of these concepts in problem-solving scenarios. It often correctly identifies relevant formulas and principles but sometimes misapplies them, leading to incorrect conclusions. The student shows potential in areas such as understanding the relationship between mass, charge, and radius in magnetic fields but needs to improve in areas like gravitational force calculations, net charge conservation, and the dynamics of collisions and oscillations. Continued practice and targeted review of these areas will help the student develop a more robust and accurate understanding of high school physics."
