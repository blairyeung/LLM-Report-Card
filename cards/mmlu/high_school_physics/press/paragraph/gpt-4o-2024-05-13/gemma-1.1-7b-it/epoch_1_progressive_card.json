  "card": "The student shows a solid understanding of wave mechanics and the relationship between tension and wavelength, correctly applying relevant formulas and principles. However, the student struggles with correctly applying Newton's third law, projectile motion, and fluid dynamics concepts. The student's reasoning is logical and structured, but there are significant gaps in conceptual understanding and application, leading to incorrect conclusions. The student would benefit from a deeper review of Newton's laws, projectile motion, and fluid dynamics to strengthen their overall grasp of high school physics concepts."
