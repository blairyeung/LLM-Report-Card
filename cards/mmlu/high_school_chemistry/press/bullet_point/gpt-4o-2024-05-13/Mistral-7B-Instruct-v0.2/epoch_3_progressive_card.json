{
  "Understanding of Periodic Table": "The student correctly identified the symbol for antimony (Sb) and demonstrated knowledge of other element symbols. This indicates a solid understanding of the periodic table.",
  "Chemical Bonding Proficiency": "The student incorrectly identified the molecular shapes and bonding types for several compounds, showing a lack of understanding in molecular geometry and VSEPR theory.",
  "Stoichiometry and Calculations": "The student struggled with the pH calculation, making errors in the application of the ionization equation and the use of the Ka value. This indicates a need for improvement in stoichiometric calculations and understanding of acid-base equilibria.",
  "Laboratory Skills and Safety": "",
  "Acid-Base Reaction Knowledge": "The student's incorrect pH calculation and misunderstanding of the ionization process of weak acids suggest a weak grasp of acid-base reactions.",
  "Thermodynamics and Reaction Spontaneity": "The student incorrectly answered the question about the Arrhenius equation, showing a misunderstanding of its applications in determining activation energy, rate constants, and shelf life.",
  "Intermolecular Forces": "The student correctly identified the molecule with the highest boiling point by considering intermolecular forces, demonstrating a good understanding of the relative strengths of hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, and London dispersion forces.",
  "Electrochemistry": "The student incorrectly answered the question about the voltaic cell potential, showing a misunderstanding of how changes in ion concentration affect cell potential."
