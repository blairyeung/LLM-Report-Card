  "card": "The student exhibits a strong grasp of high school chemistry concepts, consistently providing correct answers and detailed explanations. It shows a clear understanding of buffer solutions, molecular geometry, and historical experiments in chemistry. However, there is a noticeable gap in its understanding of spontaneity and Gibbs free energy, as well as occasional calculation errors in equilibrium problems. The student demonstrates proficiency in stoichiometry and neutralization reactions, as well as a solid understanding of intermolecular forces. Overall, the student performs well in high school chemistry but could benefit from additional practice in specific areas such as spontaneity and equilibrium calculations."
