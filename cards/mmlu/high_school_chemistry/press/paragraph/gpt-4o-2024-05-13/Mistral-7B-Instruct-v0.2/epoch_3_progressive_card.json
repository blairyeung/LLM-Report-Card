  "card": "The student shows a reasonable grasp of high school chemistry concepts but has room for improvement in integrating and applying knowledge comprehensively. It often provides detailed reasoning and demonstrates a good understanding of specific concepts, such as the ideal gas law and intermolecular forces. However, it sometimes misses the broader context or misinterprets the question, leading to incorrect answers. The student would benefit from focusing on understanding the full scope of concepts and practicing more comprehensive problem-solving strategies. Overall, the student has a solid foundation but needs to work on applying its knowledge more accurately and thoroughly."
