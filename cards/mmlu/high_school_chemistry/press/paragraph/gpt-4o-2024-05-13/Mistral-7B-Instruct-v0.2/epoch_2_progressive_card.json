  "card": "The student shows a solid grasp of certain high school chemistry concepts, such as the health hazards of radon and the formation of hydrogen bonds. It demonstrates a methodical approach to problem-solving and provides detailed reasoning for its answers. However, the student also exhibits significant misunderstandings in other areas, such as identifying irreversible reactions, calculating pKa, and understanding the properties of alkenes. These errors suggest a need for further review and clarification of fundamental chemical principles. Overall, the student has a good foundation but requires additional practice and guidance to correct misconceptions and improve accuracy in applying chemical concepts."
