  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of high school chemistry principles, particularly in areas such as vapor pressure, molarity calculations, and the ideal gas law. It demonstrates strong analytical skills and the ability to apply equations correctly. However, the student occasionally overcomplicates explanations and includes unnecessary details. There are notable gaps in understanding periodic trends, such as electronegativity, and the physical processes involved in boiling and half-life decay. The student should focus on refining its understanding of these areas and simplifying its problem-solving approach to improve accuracy and clarity."
