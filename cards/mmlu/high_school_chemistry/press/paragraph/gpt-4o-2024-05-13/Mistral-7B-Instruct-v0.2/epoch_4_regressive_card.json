  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of high school chemistry principles, particularly in areas such as vapor pressure, molarity calculations, the ideal gas law, oxidation states, acid-base chemistry, and quantum mechanics. It demonstrates strong analytical skills and the ability to apply equations correctly. The student often provides detailed reasoning and demonstrates a good understanding of specific concepts, such as the ideal gas law and intermolecular forces. However, it sometimes misses the broader context or misinterprets the question, leading to incorrect answers. There are notable gaps in understanding periodic trends, such as electronegativity, and the physical processes involved in boiling and half-life decay. The student also struggles with identifying buffer solutions, understanding molecular asymmetry, determining reaction spontaneity, identifying irreversible reactions, calculating pKa, and understanding the properties of alkenes. Additionally, the student made calculation errors in equilibrium and neutralization problems and needs to work on structuring logical reasoning more clearly. The student would benefit from focusing on understanding the full scope of concepts and practicing more comprehensive problem-solving strategies. Overall, the student has a good foundation but requires additional practice and guidance to correct misconceptions and improve accuracy in applying chemical concepts."
