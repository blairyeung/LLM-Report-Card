  "card": "The student shows a strong grasp of high school chemistry concepts, particularly in oxidation states, acid-base chemistry, and quantum mechanics. It demonstrates the ability to correctly identify and apply principles in these areas. However, the student needs to work on structuring logical reasoning more clearly, as seen in the oxidation number question. There are also notable gaps in understanding hybridization and radioactive decay calculations, as evidenced by incorrect answers and reasoning in those areas. The student should focus on improving these specific areas to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of high school chemistry."
