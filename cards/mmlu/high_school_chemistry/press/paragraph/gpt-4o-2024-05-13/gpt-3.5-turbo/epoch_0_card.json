  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of high school chemistry concepts, with particular strengths in understanding buffer solutions, molecular geometry, atomic structure, and stoichiometry. It consistently provides detailed and accurate explanations for its answers, demonstrating a clear and logical thought process. However, there are occasional misunderstandings, such as the conditions for spontaneity in thermodynamics and the primary reason for HF's liquid state at 15\u00b0C. The student shows proficiency in setting up and solving equilibrium problems, although minor calculation errors can occur. Overall, the student performs well in high school chemistry, with a few areas needing further clarification and practice."
