  "card": "The student shows a solid grasp of high school chemistry concepts, particularly in areas such as stoichiometry, gas laws, and radioactive decay. It consistently provides detailed and accurate reasoning for its answers, indicating a strong conceptual understanding. However, there are areas for improvement, such as understanding periodic trends and practical applications in chemistry. The student also needs to improve its knowledge of atomic structure and isotopes. Overall, the student performs well in high school chemistry but should focus on addressing specific gaps to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the subject."
