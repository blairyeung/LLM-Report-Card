  "card": "The student shows a solid grasp of high school chemistry principles, particularly in areas such as oxidation states, acid-base chemistry, and fundamental principles like the Pauli exclusion principle. It consistently provides thorough and logical explanations for its answers, indicating a strong conceptual understanding. However, there are areas for improvement, such as hybridization and solution preparation techniques. The student also needs to refine its approach to solving problems involving exponential decay, as seen in the half-life calculation error. Overall, the student is proficient but should focus on addressing these specific weaknesses to achieve a more comprehensive mastery of the subject."
