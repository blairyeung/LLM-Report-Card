  "card": "The student shows a solid grasp of high school chemistry concepts, consistently providing detailed and mostly accurate explanations. It demonstrates strong analytical skills and a good understanding of chemical principles, such as molecular geometry, chemical symbols, and the ideal gas law. However, the student occasionally overcomplicates problems and makes calculation errors, as seen in the pH calculation and the voltaic cell potential question. Overall, the student performs well but could benefit from double-checking calculations and simplifying their approach to problem-solving."
