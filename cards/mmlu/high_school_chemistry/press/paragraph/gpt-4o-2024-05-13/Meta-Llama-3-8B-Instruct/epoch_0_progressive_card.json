  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of high school chemistry principles, often providing accurate answers and well-reasoned explanations. It excels in understanding buffer solutions, molecular structures, and atomic theory. However, it needs to improve its understanding of spontaneity in reactions and the properties of hydrogen halides. Additionally, the student should work on refining its calculation skills to avoid errors in equilibrium problems. Overall, the student shows strong potential but could benefit from targeted practice in specific areas to enhance its performance further."
