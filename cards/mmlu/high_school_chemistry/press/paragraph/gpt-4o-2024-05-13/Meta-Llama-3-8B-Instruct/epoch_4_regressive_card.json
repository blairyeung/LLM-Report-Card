  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of high school chemistry concepts, consistently providing detailed and mostly accurate explanations. It demonstrates strong analytical skills and a good understanding of chemical principles, such as molecular geometry, chemical symbols, and the ideal gas law. The student's reasoning is logical and well-structured, often breaking down complex problems into manageable steps. However, the student occasionally overcomplicates problems and makes calculation errors. There are areas for improvement, including understanding spontaneity in reactions, properties of hydrogen halides, electron configurations, reaction reversibility, and the application of the ideal gas law. Additionally, there are misunderstandings in basic organic chemistry concepts and specific conceptual interpretations. Overall, the student shows a high level of proficiency in high school chemistry, with minor areas for improvement in specific conceptual interpretations and calculation accuracy."
