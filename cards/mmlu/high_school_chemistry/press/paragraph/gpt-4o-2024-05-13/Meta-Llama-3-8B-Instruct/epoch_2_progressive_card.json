  "card": "The student demonstrates a solid grasp of certain high school chemistry concepts, such as the health hazards of radon and the formation of hydrogen bonds. It shows a methodical approach to problem-solving, often breaking down questions into detailed steps. However, there are significant gaps in its understanding of electron configurations, reaction reversibility, and the application of the ideal gas law. The student tends to overcomplicate answers and sometimes misses the correct solution despite a thorough process. Additionally, there is a misunderstanding of basic organic chemistry concepts, as evidenced by the incorrect identification of the simplest alkene's properties. Overall, the student shows potential but needs to strengthen its conceptual understanding and avoid overcomplicating answers to improve accuracy."
