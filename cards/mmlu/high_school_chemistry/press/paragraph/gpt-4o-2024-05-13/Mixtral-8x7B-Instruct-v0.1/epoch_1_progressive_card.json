  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of high school chemistry, particularly in areas such as stoichiometry, gas laws, and phase changes. It consistently provides thorough and accurate explanations for its answers, demonstrating strong analytical skills and a good conceptual understanding. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly in understanding periodic trends and atomic structure, as well as practical applications of chemical reactions. Overall, the student shows a high level of proficiency in high school chemistry but should focus on addressing specific gaps to achieve a more comprehensive understanding."
