  "card": "The student shows a solid grasp of electron configurations and the properties of ions, as well as an understanding of the health hazards associated with radon. However, the student struggles with identifying reversible and irreversible reactions, as well as the necessary parameters for determining the molecular mass of a gas. The student also has a good understanding of suitable reducing agents and hydrogen bonding, but needs to improve their understanding of alkene structure and bonding, as well as the relationship between pH, pKa, and the dissociation of weak acids. Overall, the student demonstrates strong conceptual understanding in some areas but needs to address specific gaps in their knowledge to improve their performance in high school chemistry."
