  "card": "The student exhibits a solid understanding of high school chemistry concepts, with strengths in explaining the applications of the Arrhenius equation, identifying chemical symbols, and understanding intermolecular forces. The student's reasoning is generally clear and logical, demonstrating a good grasp of theoretical principles. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly in accurately applying VSEPR theory and understanding the properties of subatomic particles. Additionally, the student should ensure more careful verification of calculations to avoid errors. Overall, the student shows strong potential and a good foundation in chemistry, with some areas needing refinement."
