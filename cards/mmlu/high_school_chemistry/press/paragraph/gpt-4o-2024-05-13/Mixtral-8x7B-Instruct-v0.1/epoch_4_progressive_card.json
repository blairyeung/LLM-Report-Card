  "card": "The student shows a strong grasp of high school chemistry concepts, particularly in areas such as oxidation states, acid-base chemistry, titration, and solution preparation. It demonstrates a methodical approach to problem-solving and often provides detailed reasoning for its answers. However, the student occasionally makes critical errors in reasoning, such as miscalculating oxidation numbers and misunderstanding hybridization states. It also needs to improve its understanding of fundamental principles like the Pauli exclusion principle and ensure accuracy in calculations involving exponential decay. Overall, the student has a solid foundation in chemistry but should focus on refining its understanding of specific concepts and improving accuracy in problem-solving."
