  "card": "The student exhibits a high level of proficiency in high school chemistry, with a strong ability to solve problems and explain their reasoning clearly. It consistently identifies oxidation states, understands acid-base chemistry, and applies principles of chemical reactions accurately. The student is adept at using formulas and equations to solve quantitative problems, although there are occasional errors in procedural steps, such as in solution preparation. The student's understanding of hybridization and quantum mechanics is robust, though there was a minor error in identifying sp2 hybridization. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid grasp of chemistry concepts and problem-solving skills, with room for improvement in procedural accuracy and specific applications of principles."
