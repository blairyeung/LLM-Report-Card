  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of high school chemistry, particularly in areas such as chemical equations, stoichiometry, and the properties of gases. It demonstrates strong problem-solving skills and the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems. However, there are some areas that require further attention, such as understanding partial pressures, atomic structure, and the concept of half-lives. The student's reasoning is typically clear and logical, but it should focus on improving accuracy and attention to detail to avoid errors in calculations and conceptual understanding. Overall, the student shows great potential and a good foundation in chemistry, with room for improvement in specific areas."
