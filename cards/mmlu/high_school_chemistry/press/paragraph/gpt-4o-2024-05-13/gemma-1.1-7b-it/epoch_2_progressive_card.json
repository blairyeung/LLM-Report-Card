  "card": "The student shows a strong grasp of high school chemistry concepts, particularly in areas such as electron configurations, radioactive decay, and intermolecular forces. It demonstrates good quantitative skills, as evidenced by the accurate calculation of pKa. However, there are notable gaps in its understanding of reaction dynamics, experimental procedures, and basic organic chemistry structures. The student needs to improve its comprehension of irreversible reactions and the requirements for determining molecular mass in experiments. Additionally, a review of the structural characteristics of alkenes is recommended. Overall, the student has a solid foundation but requires targeted practice to address specific weaknesses."
