  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of high school chemistry concepts, particularly in buffer solutions, stoichiometry, and equilibrium calculations. It shows strong analytical skills and the ability to apply chemical principles to solve problems. However, there are areas for improvement, such as understanding molecular geometry, Gibbs free energy, and the role of intermolecular forces. The student tends to provide detailed reasoning, which is a strength, but occasionally makes conceptual errors that suggest a need for deeper review in specific topics. Overall, the student performs well but should focus on clarifying misunderstandings in molecular structure and thermodynamics to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of high school chemistry."
