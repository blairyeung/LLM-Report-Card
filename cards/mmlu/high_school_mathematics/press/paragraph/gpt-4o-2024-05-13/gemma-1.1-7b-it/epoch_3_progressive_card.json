  "card": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of algebraic manipulation and solving equations, which is a strong point in its mathematical skill set. However, the student needs to improve its understanding of probability, combinatorial reasoning, and number theory concepts such as powerful numbers. The student also needs to work on accurately interpreting problem requirements and ensuring all steps in its reasoning are correct. Overall, the student shows potential but requires further practice and clarification in specific areas to achieve a more consistent performance in high school mathematics."
