  "card": "The student exhibits a strong foundational understanding of high school mathematics concepts, including basic arithmetic, algebraic manipulation, and the application of theorems. It demonstrates the ability to follow logical steps and apply mathematical principles correctly in intermediate stages. However, the student needs to improve its understanding of more advanced topics such as factorials, binomial coefficients, logarithms, function inverses, geometric properties, probability, and number theory concepts. The student's reasoning often includes errors in algebraic manipulation and misinterpretations of mathematical properties, suggesting a need for a stronger foundational understanding and more careful problem-solving strategies. To improve, the student should focus on reinforcing core concepts, verifying calculations, and practicing a variety of problem types to build a more robust mathematical foundation. Overall, the student shows promise but requires further practice and clarification in specific areas to achieve more consistent accuracy and performance in high school mathematics."
