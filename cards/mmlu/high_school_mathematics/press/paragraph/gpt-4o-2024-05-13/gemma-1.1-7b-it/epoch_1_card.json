  "card": "The student shows a solid grasp of basic arithmetic and combinatorial problems, as evidenced by correct answers in calculating the number of specific digit integers and solving mean-related problems. However, the student struggles with more advanced mathematical concepts such as factorials, binomial coefficients, logarithms, and function inverses. The student's reasoning often indicates a partial understanding but lacks the depth required for accurate solutions. To improve, the student should focus on reinforcing their understanding of advanced mathematical operations and concepts, ensuring they can apply these correctly in various contexts.The student shows a basic understanding of high school mathematics but struggles with applying concepts correctly across different topics. It demonstrates proficiency in solving straightforward algebraic equations but has difficulty with more complex problems involving geometric properties, probability, and inequalities. The student's reasoning often includes errors in algebraic manipulation and misinterpretations of mathematical properties, suggesting a need for a stronger foundational understanding and more careful problem-solving strategies. To improve, the student should focus on reinforcing core concepts and practicing a variety of problem types to enhance its conceptual understanding and reasoning skills."
