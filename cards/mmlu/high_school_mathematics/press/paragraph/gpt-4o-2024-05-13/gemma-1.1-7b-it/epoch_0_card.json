  "card": "The student shows a solid grasp of basic arithmetic and combinatorial problems, as evidenced by correct answers in calculating the number of specific digit integers and solving mean-related problems. However, the student struggles with more advanced mathematical concepts such as factorials, binomial coefficients, logarithms, and function inverses. The student's reasoning often indicates a partial understanding but lacks the depth required for accurate solutions. To improve, the student should focus on reinforcing their understanding of advanced mathematical operations and concepts, ensuring they can apply these correctly in various contexts."
