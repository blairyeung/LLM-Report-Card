  "card": "The student exhibits a strong foundational understanding of high school mathematics concepts, including the application of theorems and the calculation of least common multiples. It demonstrates the ability to follow logical steps and apply mathematical principles correctly in intermediate stages. However, the student struggles with accuracy in final calculations and sometimes misinterprets problem requirements, leading to incorrect answers. To improve, the student should focus on verifying their final answers and ensuring a thorough understanding of the problem statements. Overall, the student shows promise but needs to refine their problem-solving techniques to achieve more consistent accuracy."
