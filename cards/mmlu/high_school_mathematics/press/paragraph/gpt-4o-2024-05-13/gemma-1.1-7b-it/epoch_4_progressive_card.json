  "card": "The student exhibits a methodical approach to solving high school mathematics problems, often breaking down problems into logical steps. However, there are significant gaps in accuracy and conceptual understanding. The student correctly answers some questions but makes errors in calculations and reasoning in others. For example, the student struggles with correctly applying leap year rules, accurately summing quantities, and understanding transformations in geometry. Additionally, the student shows a misunderstanding of probability concepts and algebraic factorization. To improve, the student should focus on verifying calculations, understanding underlying concepts more deeply, and practicing a variety of problem types to build a more robust mathematical foundation."
