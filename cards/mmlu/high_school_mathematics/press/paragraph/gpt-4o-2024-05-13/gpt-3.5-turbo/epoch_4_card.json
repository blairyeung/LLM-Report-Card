  "card": "The student exhibits a high level of proficiency in high school mathematics, consistently providing correct answers and demonstrating clear, logical reasoning. It shows a solid grasp of basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, probability, prime factorization, least common multiples, direct proportionality, and sequence analysis. The student effectively applies mathematical theorems and principles to solve problems, although it occasionally makes errors in the final steps of complex calculations. There are areas for improvement, particularly in understanding more complex topics such as factorials, combinations, modular arithmetic, function transformations, advanced number theory, arithmetic sequences, and the properties of sums in calculus. The student also needs to work on finding the inverse of functions. Overall, the student performs well but should focus on refining its approach to more complex mathematical problems to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of high school mathematics."
