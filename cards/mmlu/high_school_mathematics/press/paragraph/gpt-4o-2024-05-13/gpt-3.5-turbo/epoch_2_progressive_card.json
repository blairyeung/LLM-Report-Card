  "card": "The student shows a solid understanding of high school mathematics, particularly in prime factorization, least common multiples, and direct proportionality. It effectively applies mathematical theorems and principles to solve problems, although it occasionally makes errors in the final steps of complex calculations. The student excels in identifying necessary prime factors and calculating least common multiples, demonstrating strong analytical skills. However, it could benefit from further practice in advanced number theory and arithmetic sequences to improve accuracy and deepen its understanding of these areas. Overall, the student performs well but should focus on refining its approach to more complex mathematical problems."
