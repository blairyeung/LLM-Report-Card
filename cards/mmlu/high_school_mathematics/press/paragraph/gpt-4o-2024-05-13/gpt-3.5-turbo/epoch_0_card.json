  "card": "The student shows a solid understanding of basic arithmetic, algebra, and combinatorial principles. It can correctly simplify fractions, solve for unknowns in algebraic equations, and understand the concept of mean. However, it struggles with more complex problems involving factorials and combinations, indicating a need for further practice in these areas. The student also shows some misunderstanding in finding the inverse of functions, which suggests a need for a deeper conceptual understanding of this topic. Overall, the student demonstrates a good foundation in high school mathematics but needs to work on more complex problem-solving and conceptual understanding to improve further."
