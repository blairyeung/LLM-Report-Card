  "card": "The student exhibits a solid understanding of basic arithmetic and probability concepts, as evidenced by correct answers and clear reasoning in related questions. However, the student struggles with more advanced topics such as modular arithmetic, function transformations, and factorization. The student's approach to problem-solving is generally logical, but there are gaps in the application of certain mathematical principles. To improve, the student should focus on strengthening their understanding of advanced mathematical concepts and practice applying these concepts to various problems. Overall, the student shows potential but needs to address specific areas of weakness to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of high school mathematics."
