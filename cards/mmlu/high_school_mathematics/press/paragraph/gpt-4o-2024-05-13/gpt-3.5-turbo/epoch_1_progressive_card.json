  "card": "The student exhibits a solid grasp of high school mathematics, particularly in algebra, geometry, and probability. It demonstrates strong problem-solving skills and logical reasoning in most areas, successfully solving complex equations and applying mathematical theorems. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly in understanding the properties of sums in calculus and combinatorial mathematics. The student occasionally misinterprets or misapplies mathematical principles, leading to incorrect answers. Overall, the student shows promise and a good foundation in high school mathematics, with room to refine its understanding of specific advanced topics."
