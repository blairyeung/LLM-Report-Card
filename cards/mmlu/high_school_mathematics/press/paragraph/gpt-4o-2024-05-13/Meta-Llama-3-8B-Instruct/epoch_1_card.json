  "card": "The student shows a solid understanding of fundamental high school mathematics concepts, such as factorials, mean calculations, and basic function inversions. It is methodical in its approach and often breaks down problems step-by-step, which is a good practice. However, the student struggles with more complex problems, particularly those involving combinatorics, logarithms, and composite functions. These areas may require additional practice and review. The student's reasoning is generally clear, but it occasionally leads to incorrect conclusions due to misunderstandings or calculation errors. Overall, the student has a good foundation but needs to work on more advanced topics to improve its performance.The student exhibits a strong foundational understanding of high school mathematics, particularly in calculus and algebra. It is capable of breaking down complex problems and providing detailed reasoning. However, there are inconsistencies in its accuracy and final answer verification, which suggests a need for improved attention to detail and problem verification. The student shows an ability to self-correct and understand intermediate steps but occasionally misapplies concepts or makes calculation errors. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of mathematical concepts but should focus on refining its problem-solving accuracy and verification processes."
