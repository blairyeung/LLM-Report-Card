  "card": "The student demonstrates a solid grasp of basic arithmetic operations and proportionality, successfully solving problems related to mean scores and direct proportionality. However, the student faces challenges with more advanced topics such as modular arithmetic, least common multiples, and the properties of divisors. The student's approach often includes correct intermediate steps but sometimes leads to incorrect final answers, suggesting areas for improvement in conceptual understanding and computational accuracy. Additionally, the student tends to overcomplicate solutions, which may indicate a need for more practice in simplifying and streamlining problem-solving processes. Overall, the student shows potential but would benefit from targeted practice in specific areas to enhance their mathematical reasoning and accuracy."
