  "card": "The student exhibits a solid understanding of basic high school mathematics concepts, particularly in arithmetic operations and simple probability. It consistently provides clear, step-by-step reasoning for its answers, which demonstrates a methodical approach to problem-solving. However, the student struggles with more advanced topics such as function transformations, combinatorial probability, and number theory. These areas reveal gaps in its conceptual understanding and application of mathematical principles. The student would benefit from targeted practice in these areas to improve its overall performance in high school mathematics."
