  "card": "The student shows a solid understanding of fundamental high school mathematics concepts and is methodical in its approach, often breaking down problems step-by-step. It has a strong grasp of calculus and algebra, capable of breaking down complex problems and providing detailed reasoning. However, the student struggles with more advanced topics such as combinatorics, logarithms, composite functions, modular arithmetic, least common multiples, and the properties of divisors. Additionally, it has difficulty with simplifying fractions, solving quadratic equations accurately, interpreting the sum of solutions, logical reasoning in counting days, understanding the growth pattern of sequences, completing the square, and calculating the radius of a circle. The student also shows confusion in the composition of functions and needs to work on recognizing periodicity in alternating functions. There are inconsistencies in its accuracy and final answer verification, suggesting a need for improved attention to detail and problem verification. The student tends to overcomplicate solutions, indicating a need for more practice in simplifying and streamlining problem-solving processes. Overall, the student has a good foundation in high school mathematics but needs to focus on improving its problem-solving accuracy and logical reasoning skills."
