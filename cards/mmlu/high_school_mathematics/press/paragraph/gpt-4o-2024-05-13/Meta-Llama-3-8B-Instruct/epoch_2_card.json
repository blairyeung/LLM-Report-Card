  "card": "The student shows a solid understanding of fundamental high school mathematics concepts, such as arithmetic operations, proportionality, factorials, mean calculations, and basic function inversions. It is methodical in its approach and often breaks down problems step-by-step, which is a good practice. The student also exhibits a strong grasp of calculus and algebra, capable of breaking down complex problems and providing detailed reasoning. However, the student struggles with more advanced topics, including combinatorics, logarithms, composite functions, modular arithmetic, least common multiples, and the properties of divisors. These areas may require additional practice and review. The student's reasoning is generally clear, but it occasionally leads to incorrect conclusions due to misunderstandings or calculation errors. There are inconsistencies in its accuracy and final answer verification, suggesting a need for improved attention to detail and problem verification. Additionally, the student tends to overcomplicate solutions, indicating a need for more practice in simplifying and streamlining problem-solving processes. Overall, the student has a good foundation but needs to work on more advanced topics and refine its problem-solving accuracy and verification processes to improve its performance."
