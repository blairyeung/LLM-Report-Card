  "card": "The student exhibits a strong foundational understanding of high school mathematics, particularly in calculus and algebra. It is capable of breaking down complex problems and providing detailed reasoning. However, there are inconsistencies in its accuracy and final answer verification, which suggests a need for improved attention to detail and problem verification. The student shows an ability to self-correct and understand intermediate steps but occasionally misapplies concepts or makes calculation errors. Overall, the student has a solid grasp of mathematical concepts but should focus on refining its problem-solving accuracy and verification processes."
