  "card": "The student shows a solid understanding of fundamental high school mathematics concepts, such as factorials, mean calculations, and basic function inversions. It is methodical in its approach and often breaks down problems step-by-step, which is a good practice. However, the student struggles with more complex problems, particularly those involving combinatorics, logarithms, and composite functions. These areas may require additional practice and review. The student's reasoning is generally clear, but it occasionally leads to incorrect conclusions due to misunderstandings or calculation errors. Overall, the student has a good foundation but needs to work on more advanced topics to improve its performance."
