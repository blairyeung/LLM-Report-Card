  "card": "The student exhibits a solid understanding of basic high school mathematics concepts, particularly in arithmetic operations, simple probability, calculus, and algebra. It consistently provides clear, step-by-step reasoning for its answers, demonstrating a methodical approach to problem-solving. However, the student struggles with more advanced topics such as combinatorics, logarithms, composite functions, modular arithmetic, least common multiples, properties of divisors, function transformations, combinatorial probability, and number theory. These areas reveal gaps in its conceptual understanding and application of mathematical principles. Additionally, the student has difficulty with simplifying fractions, solving quadratic equations accurately, interpreting the sum of solutions, logical reasoning in counting days, understanding the growth pattern of sequences, completing the square, and calculating the radius of a circle. There are inconsistencies in its accuracy and final answer verification, suggesting a need for improved attention to detail and problem verification. The student tends to overcomplicate solutions, indicating a need for more practice in simplifying and streamlining problem-solving processes. Overall, the student has a good foundation in high school mathematics but needs to focus on improving its problem-solving accuracy and logical reasoning skills."
