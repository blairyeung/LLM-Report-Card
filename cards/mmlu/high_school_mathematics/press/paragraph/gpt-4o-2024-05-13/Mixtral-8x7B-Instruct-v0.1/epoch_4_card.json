  "card": "The student exhibits a solid understanding of basic arithmetic operations, proportionality, and algebraic concepts, particularly in solving equations and manipulating expressions. It demonstrates clear reasoning and correct answers in these areas. However, the student struggles with more advanced topics such as factorials, logarithms, modular arithmetic, properties of divisors, periodic functions, and common factors. Additionally, there are significant gaps in understanding geometric concepts, probability, combinatorial mathematics, and specific mathematical properties like those of powerful numbers. The student's problem-solving approach is methodical but can be overly complicated, leading to errors. To improve, the student should focus on simplifying its reasoning, ensuring a full understanding of problem requirements, and practicing advanced number theory problems. Strengthening its understanding of geometric intuition and the application of mathematical theorems will also be beneficial. Overall, the student has a good foundation but needs to refine its approach to more complex problems to improve accuracy and achieve a more consistent performance in high school mathematics."
