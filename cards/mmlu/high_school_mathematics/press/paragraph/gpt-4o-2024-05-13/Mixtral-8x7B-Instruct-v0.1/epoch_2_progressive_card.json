  "card": "The student shows a good understanding of basic arithmetic operations and proportionality, as evidenced by correct answers and clear reasoning in these areas. However, the student has difficulty with more advanced topics such as modular arithmetic and the properties of divisors. The student's approach to problem-solving is methodical, but there are occasional errors in the final steps, leading to incorrect answers. To improve, the student should focus on practicing advanced number theory problems and verifying their solutions more thoroughly. Overall, the student has a solid foundation but needs to work on higher-level mathematical concepts and problem-solving accuracy."
