  "card": "The student demonstrates a solid grasp of basic arithmetic and algebraic concepts, successfully solving problems related to means and function inverses. However, it struggles with more complex topics such as factorials and logarithms, often making errors in reasoning or misinterpreting the problem requirements. The student's problem-solving approach is methodical but sometimes overly complicated, leading to incorrect answers. Continued practice and focus on simplifying mathematical expressions and correctly interpreting problem statements will help improve its performance in high school mathematics.The student demonstrates a reasonable understanding of algebraic manipulation and logical reasoning, as evidenced by correct answers in some algebra-related problems. However, the student shows significant gaps in understanding geometric concepts, probability, and combinatorial mathematics. The student's approach to problems can sometimes be overly complex, leading to incorrect answers. It would benefit from focusing on simplifying its approach and strengthening its understanding of geometric intuition and the application of mathematical theorems. Overall, the student has a solid foundation but needs to address specific weaknesses to improve its performance in high school mathematics."
