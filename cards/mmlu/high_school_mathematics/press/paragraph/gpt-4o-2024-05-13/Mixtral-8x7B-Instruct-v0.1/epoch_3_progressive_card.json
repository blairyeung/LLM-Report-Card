  "card": "The student exhibits a solid understanding of algebraic concepts and problem-solving techniques, particularly in solving equations and manipulating expressions. However, it struggles with probability, combinatorial reasoning, and understanding specific mathematical properties, such as those of powerful numbers. The student also needs to improve its ability to interpret and solve problems involving dates and functional compositions. Overall, the student shows potential but requires further practice and clarification in certain areas to achieve a more consistent performance in high school mathematics."
