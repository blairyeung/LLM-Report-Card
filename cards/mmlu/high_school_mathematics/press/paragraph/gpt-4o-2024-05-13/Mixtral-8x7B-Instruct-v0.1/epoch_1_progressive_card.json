  "card": "The student demonstrates a reasonable understanding of algebraic manipulation and logical reasoning, as evidenced by correct answers in some algebra-related problems. However, the student shows significant gaps in understanding geometric concepts, probability, and combinatorial mathematics. The student's approach to problems can sometimes be overly complex, leading to incorrect answers. It would benefit from focusing on simplifying its approach and strengthening its understanding of geometric intuition and the application of mathematical theorems. Overall, the student has a solid foundation but needs to address specific weaknesses to improve its performance in high school mathematics."
