  "card": "The student demonstrates a solid grasp of basic arithmetic and algebraic concepts, successfully solving problems related to means and function inverses. However, it struggles with more complex topics such as factorials and logarithms, often making errors in reasoning or misinterpreting the problem requirements. The student's problem-solving approach is methodical but sometimes overly complicated, leading to incorrect answers. Continued practice and focus on simplifying mathematical expressions and correctly interpreting problem statements will help improve its performance in high school mathematics."
