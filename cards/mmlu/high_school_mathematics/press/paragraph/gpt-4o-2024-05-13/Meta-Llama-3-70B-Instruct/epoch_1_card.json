  "card": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of high school mathematics concepts, particularly in areas such as factorials, combinatorics, logarithms, and inverse functions. It consistently uses a step-by-step approach to solve problems and shows proficiency in algebraic manipulation. However, the student occasionally makes errors in detailed calculations, indicating a need for more careful verification of arithmetic steps. Overall, the student performs well in high school mathematics, with minor areas for improvement in attention to detail.The student demonstrates a solid understanding of algebraic manipulation and geometric properties, often breaking down problems into smaller, manageable steps. It excels in solving equations and understanding binomial coefficients. However, the student occasionally struggles with interpreting problem statements correctly, particularly in word problems involving fractions and ratios. Additionally, it sometimes misapplies mathematical properties, leading to incorrect conclusions. Overall, the student shows strong problem-solving skills but needs to improve its interpretation and application of problem conditions."
