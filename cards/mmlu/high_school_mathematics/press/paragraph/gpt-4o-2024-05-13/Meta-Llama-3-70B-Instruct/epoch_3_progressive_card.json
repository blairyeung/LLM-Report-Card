  "card": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of number theory, algebra, sequences, and function composition. It consistently breaks down problems into smaller steps and follows a logical progression in reasoning. However, the student occasionally makes errors in intermediate calculations or assumptions, leading to incorrect conclusions. The student shows a good grasp of complex function evaluation but needs to improve in areas such as probability and calendar calculations. Overall, the student has a solid foundation in high school mathematics but should focus on refining its problem-solving techniques and attention to detail."
