  "card": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of basic arithmetic operations and their application in word problems, as well as a good grasp of geometric transformations, particularly reflections. However, the student struggles with calendar calculations and determining the day of the week after a certain number of days. Additionally, the student has difficulty with factorization and identifying common factors, as well as higher-level factorization problems. The student's reasoning patterns are generally strong, using a step-by-step approach to break down problems, but they sometimes overcomplicate problems or misinterpret the requirements, leading to incorrect conclusions. The student should focus on improving their skills in calendar calculations and factorization to enhance their overall performance in high school mathematics."
