  "card": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of high school mathematics concepts, including factorials, combinatorics, logarithms, inverse functions, modular arithmetic, prime factorization, direct proportionality, number theory, algebra, sequences, function composition, and geometric transformations. It consistently uses a step-by-step approach to solve problems and shows proficiency in algebraic manipulation and solving equations. The student is adept at breaking down problems into smaller, manageable steps and has a good grasp of complex function evaluation and geometric properties. However, the student occasionally makes errors in detailed calculations and intermediate steps, struggles with interpreting problem statements correctly, particularly in word problems involving fractions and ratios, and sometimes misapplies mathematical properties, leading to incorrect conclusions. Additionally, the student has difficulty with identifying the correct number of arithmetic sequences that sum to a given value, probability, calendar calculations, and higher-level factorization problems. To enhance its overall performance, the student should focus on careful verification of arithmetic steps, practice interpreting and solving word problems, work on understanding and applying mathematical properties correctly, engage in additional practice with sequences and series, improve skills in probability and calendar calculations, simplify problem-solving approaches, and enhance understanding of factorization and identifying common factors."
