  "card": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of high school mathematics concepts, particularly in modular arithmetic, prime factorization, and direct proportionality. It consistently uses a step-by-step approach to solve problems and provides detailed explanations for its reasoning. The student correctly calculates the mean of a set of numbers and shows proficiency in determining factors and least common multiples. However, it struggles with identifying the correct number of arithmetic sequences that sum to a given value, indicating a potential gap in understanding sequences and series. Overall, the student exhibits a solid grasp of mathematical concepts but could benefit from further practice in sequences and series."
