  "card": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of high school mathematics concepts, particularly in date calculation, basic arithmetic, number theory, and probability. It consistently uses a step-by-step approach to solve problems and provides detailed explanations for each step, which aids in verifying the correctness of its solutions. However, there is a notable gap in understanding periodic functions and their transformations, as evidenced by the incorrect answer in the related problem. The student also shows proficiency in geometric transformations, accurately reflecting points across a line. Overall, the student performs well in high school mathematics but could benefit from additional practice and instruction in periodic functions and their transformations."
