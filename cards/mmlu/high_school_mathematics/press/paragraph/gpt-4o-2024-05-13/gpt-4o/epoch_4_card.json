  "card": "The student demonstrates a high level of proficiency in high school mathematics, consistently applying appropriate mathematical concepts and techniques to solve a variety of problems. It shows a strong understanding of topics such as factorials, fractions, combinatorics, logarithms, mean calculations, inverse functions, integral approximations, algebraic manipulation, geometric interpretation, probability, binomial coefficients, number theory, prime factorization, direct proportionality, arithmetic sequences, basic statistical measures, date calculation, basic arithmetic, and function composition. The student's methodical, step-by-step approach ensures clarity and accuracy in their solutions, and it provides detailed explanations that indicate a solid ability to communicate mathematical reasoning effectively. The student consistently applies logical reasoning, pays close attention to detail, and effectively recognizes patterns, leading to accurate and efficient problem-solving. However, there is a notable gap in understanding periodic functions and their transformations, which could benefit from additional practice and instruction. Overall, the student's performance is exemplary, with a high level of mathematical competence and problem-solving skills."
