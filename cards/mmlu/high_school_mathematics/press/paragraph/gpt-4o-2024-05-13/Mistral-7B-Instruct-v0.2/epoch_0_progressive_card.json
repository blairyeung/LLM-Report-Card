  "card": "The student demonstrates a methodical approach to problem-solving and persistence in attempting to solve complex problems. However, the student frequently makes errors in basic arithmetic and algebraic manipulations, leading to incorrect answers. The student's understanding of key high school mathematics concepts, such as factorials, prime factorization, binomial coefficients, logarithms, and function inverses, is weak. The student tends to overcomplicate problems and misapply mathematical formulas, resulting in logical errors. To improve, the student should focus on strengthening their foundational knowledge and practicing the correct application of mathematical principles."
