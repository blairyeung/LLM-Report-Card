  "card": "The student demonstrates a methodical and persistent approach to problem-solving, showing a strong understanding of high school mathematics concepts, particularly in functions, geometry, algebraic manipulation, probability, number theory, and geometric transformations. It effectively uses logical reasoning and a step-by-step approach to derive solutions. However, the student frequently makes errors in basic arithmetic and algebraic manipulations, leading to incorrect answers. There is a tendency to overcomplicate problems and misapply mathematical formulas, resulting in logical errors. Additionally, the student occasionally struggles with interpreting problem statements accurately and verifying final answers against problem constraints. To improve, the student should focus on strengthening their foundational knowledge, practicing the correct application of mathematical principles, simplifying their approach to problem-solving, and verifying solutions more thoroughly. Targeted practice in specific areas such as modular arithmetic and periodic functions would also be beneficial."
