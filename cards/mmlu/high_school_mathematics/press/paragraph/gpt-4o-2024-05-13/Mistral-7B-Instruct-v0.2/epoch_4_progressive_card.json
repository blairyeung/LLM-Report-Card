  "card": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of basic probability and geometric transformations, particularly in reflecting points across lines. However, it struggles with modular arithmetic and periodic functions, indicating a need for further practice in these areas. The student's calculation accuracy is generally good but occasionally falters, leading to incorrect answers. Logical reasoning is a strength, as the student often follows a clear, step-by-step approach to problem-solving, though it sometimes misinterprets problem requirements. Overall, the student shows promise but would benefit from targeted practice in specific areas to improve its performance in high school mathematics."
