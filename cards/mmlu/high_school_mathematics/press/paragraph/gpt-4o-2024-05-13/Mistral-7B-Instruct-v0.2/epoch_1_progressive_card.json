  "card": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of high school mathematics concepts, particularly in areas involving functions, geometry, and algebraic manipulation. It effectively uses logical reasoning and mathematical properties to derive solutions. However, the student occasionally struggles with interpreting problem statements accurately, leading to incorrect conclusions. Additionally, there is a tendency to overcomplicate problems or assume errors in the problem statement when the correct solution is not immediately apparent. The student would benefit from focusing on verifying their solutions more thoroughly and ensuring they meet all given conditions and constraints."
