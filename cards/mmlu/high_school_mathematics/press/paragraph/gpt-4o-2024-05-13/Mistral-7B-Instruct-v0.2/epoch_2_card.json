  "card": "The student demonstrates a methodical approach to problem-solving and persistence in attempting to solve complex problems. However, the student frequently makes errors in basic arithmetic and algebraic manipulations, leading to incorrect answers. The student's understanding of key high school mathematics concepts, such as factorials, prime factorization, binomial coefficients, logarithms, and function inverses, is weak. The student tends to overcomplicate problems and misapply mathematical formulas, resulting in logical errors. To improve, the student should focus on strengthening their foundational knowledge and practicing the correct application of mathematical principles.The student demonstrates a strong understanding of high school mathematics concepts, particularly in areas involving functions, geometry, and algebraic manipulation. It effectively uses logical reasoning and mathematical properties to derive solutions. However, the student occasionally struggles with interpreting problem statements accurately, leading to incorrect conclusions. Additionally, there is a tendency to overcomplicate problems or assume errors in the problem statement when the correct solution is not immediately apparent. The student would benefit from focusing on verifying their solutions more thoroughly and ensuring they meet all given conditions and constraints.The student demonstrates a solid understanding of basic high school mathematics concepts, including prime factorization, least common multiple (LCM), and direct proportionality. It shows a willingness to engage with complex problems and employs logical, methodical approaches to problem-solving. However, the student frequently misapplies mathematical concepts and overcomplicates problems, leading to incorrect answers. There is a tendency to make fundamental reasoning errors and a lack of verification of final answers against problem constraints. The student would benefit from focusing on simplifying their approach and ensuring that their final answers align with the problem requirements."
