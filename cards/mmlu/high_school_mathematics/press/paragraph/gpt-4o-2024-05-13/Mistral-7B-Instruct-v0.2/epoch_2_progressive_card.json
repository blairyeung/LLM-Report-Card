  "card": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of basic high school mathematics concepts, including prime factorization, least common multiple (LCM), and direct proportionality. It shows a willingness to engage with complex problems and employs logical, methodical approaches to problem-solving. However, the student frequently misapplies mathematical concepts and overcomplicates problems, leading to incorrect answers. There is a tendency to make fundamental reasoning errors and a lack of verification of final answers against problem constraints. The student would benefit from focusing on simplifying their approach and ensuring that their final answers align with the problem requirements."
