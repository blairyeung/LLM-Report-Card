  "card": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of high school mathematics concepts, particularly in algebraic manipulation, geometric properties, and the application of the triangle inequality theorem. It shows strong problem-solving skills and a methodical approach to breaking down complex problems. However, the student occasionally misinterprets problem statements and makes logical errors, particularly in probability and the ordering of Riemann sums. Continued practice in these areas, along with a focus on careful interpretation of problem conditions, will help the student improve accuracy and deepen its conceptual understanding."
