  "card": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of high school mathematics concepts, consistently providing accurate answers across a wide range of topics. It excels in areas such as factorials, fractions, combinatorics, logarithms, mean calculations, inverse functions, modular arithmetic, prime factorization, least common multiple, direct proportionality, and periodic functions. The student is proficient in algebraic manipulation, geometric properties, and the application of the triangle inequality theorem. It consistently uses a methodical, step-by-step approach to solve problems, breaking down complex problems into simpler parts. The student's reasoning is logically consistent and well-structured, with clear explanations and justifications for each step. It recognizes and corrects errors, demonstrating a good understanding of underlying concepts. However, the student occasionally misinterprets problem statements and makes logical errors, particularly in probability and the ordering of Riemann sums. There is also room for improvement in understanding and applying the properties of arithmetic sequences. Overall, the student shows a high level of proficiency and conceptual understanding in high school mathematics, with minor areas for improvement in verifying the completeness of solutions and avoiding overcomplication in probability calculations."
