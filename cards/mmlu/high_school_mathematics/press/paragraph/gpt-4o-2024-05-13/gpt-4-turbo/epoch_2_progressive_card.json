  "card": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of high school mathematics concepts, particularly in modular arithmetic, prime factorization, least common multiple, direct proportionality, and mean calculation. They consistently follow logical steps in their reasoning and pay close attention to detail, ensuring accurate calculations and correct application of mathematical principles. However, there is room for improvement in understanding and applying the properties of arithmetic sequences, as evidenced by an error in determining the number of sequences that sum to a given value. Overall, the student shows a high level of proficiency in most areas of high school mathematics, with a minor area for improvement in arithmetic sequences."
