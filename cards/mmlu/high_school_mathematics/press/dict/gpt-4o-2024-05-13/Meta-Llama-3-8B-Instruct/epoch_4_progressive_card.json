  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algebraic manipulation.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It tends to follow a step-by-step approach in solving algebraic problems, often breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.",
    "strength": "It correctly applies basic algebraic operations and manipulations in straightforward contexts, such as solving for days of the week or summing series of numbers.",
    "weakness": "It struggles with more complex algebraic manipulations, particularly in problems requiring deeper insight or non-standard approaches, such as incorrect handling of function transformations and factorizations leading to erroneous conclusions."
  },
  "Geometric Reasoning Ability": {
    "overview": "The student shows an understanding of basic geometric transformations but makes errors in execution.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It attempts to apply geometric transformations systematically but sometimes misinterprets the transformation rules or the coordinate implications.",
    "strength": "It can identify the type of geometric transformation required, such as reflections across a line.",
    "weakness": "It incorrectly calculates the results of transformations, leading to wrong answers, as seen in the reflection of coordinates across the line y = x."

  "Theorem Application Knowledge": {
    "overview": "The student has some knowledge of theorems but shows inconsistency in applying them correctly.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It recognizes when a theorem might be applicable but sometimes misapplies the conditions or conclusions of the theorem.",
    "strength": "It can identify relevant theorems or mathematical properties that are applicable to the problem at hand.",
    "weakness": "It incorrectly applies theorems, as seen in the misunderstanding of periodic function transformations and factor relationships, leading to incorrect answers."

  "Problem Solving Strategy": {
    "overview": "The student generally follows a structured approach to problem solving.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It often opts for a breakdown strategy, parsing the problem into components and addressing each sequentially.",
    "strength": "It is methodical in its approach, which helps in systematically tackling problems and ensuring steps are not overlooked.",
    "weakness": "It sometimes adheres too rigidly to its initial strategy, which can lead to oversight of simpler or more efficient solutions."
