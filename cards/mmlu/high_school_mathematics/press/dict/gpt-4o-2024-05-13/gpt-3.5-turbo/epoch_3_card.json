    "overview": "The student demonstrates a methodical approach to problem solving, using a step-by-step process to break down and solve complex problems.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It often uses a structured approach, breaking problems into smaller, manageable parts and applying mathematical principles to each part, and often uses a methodical approach, breaking down problems into smaller, manageable parts and solving each part sequentially.",
    "strength": "This approach is effective in correctly solving problems involving multiple steps or concepts, such as finding least common multiples or calculating mean scores, and effectively uses complementary counting to solve probability problems and systematically checks each option in multiple-choice questions.",
    "weakness": "The student sometimes overlooks simpler or more direct methods, potentially complicating solutions or leading to errors, and sometimes fails to correctly follow through with its strategy, leading to incorrect conclusions, as seen in the complex function composition problem."
