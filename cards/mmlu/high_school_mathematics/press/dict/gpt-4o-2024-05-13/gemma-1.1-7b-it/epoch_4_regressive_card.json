  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": {
    "overview": "Evaluates the student's ability to manipulate algebraic expressions and solve equations.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student often follows correct procedures and attempts to simplify or solve equations but sometimes misapplies formulas, operations, or basic algebraic steps, leading to incorrect conclusions and miscalculations. It often misinterprets the requirements of algebraic manipulation.",
    "strength": "The student correctly applies basic algebraic manipulations in simpler contexts and can set up equations from word problems, as seen in the problem about John's souvenir hat pins. It is also capable of recalling and attempting to apply complex algebraic theorems such as Fermat's Little Theorem.",
    "weakness": "The student struggles with more complex algebraic manipulations, particularly in the context of function composition, inverse functions, and correctly solving equations when multiple steps are involved or when the algebraic manipulation is non-trivial.
