  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": {
    "overview": "Evaluates the student's ability to manipulate algebraic expressions and solve equations.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student often follows correct procedures and attempts to simplify or solve equations but sometimes misapplies formulas, operations, or basic algebraic steps, leading to incorrect conclusions and miscalculations.",
    "strength": "The student correctly applies basic algebraic manipulations in simpler contexts and can set up equations from word problems, as seen in the problem about John's souvenir hat pins. It is also capable of recalling and attempting to apply complex algebraic theorems such as Fermat's Little Theorem.",
    "weakness": "The student struggles with more complex algebraic manipulations, particularly in the context of function composition, inverse functions, and correctly solving equations when multiple steps are involved or when the algebraic manipulation is non-trivial. Critical errors in the application of complex theorems, such as Fermat's Little Theorem, lead to incorrect conclusions. For example, in solving exponential equations, it incorrectly equates powers leading to wrong answers."

  "Data Analysis Skills": {
    "overview": "Assesses the student's ability to interpret and analyze numerical data to solve problems.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student demonstrates a methodical approach to solving problems involving numerical data and attempts to apply formulas and concepts from probability, but there is confusion in understanding and applying the correct formulas or interpreting the conditions and scenarios, leading to incorrect conclusions.",
    "strength": "The student effectively uses arithmetic operations to solve problems involving averages and sums, as seen in calculating the mean with additional data points and the correct summation of quiz scores.",
    "weakness": "There is limited evidence of handling more complex data analysis or statistical concepts beyond basic arithmetic operations. The student misapplies probability concepts and struggles with the final interpretation or rounding of results, leading to incorrect answers in contexts requiring precise calculation of means. It often misinterprets the conditions or data given in a problem, leading to incorrect conclusions or answers."
  },
  "Function Understanding": {
    "overview": "Measures the student's grasp of functions, their compositions, inverses, and properties, including graph interpretation.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student attempts to apply function operations and properties but often makes critical errors in the process, particularly with function inverses and applying these properties correctly to solve problems involving sums and distances. It shows a basic understanding of functions but struggles with applying functions correctly in complex scenarios.",
    "strength": "The student can perform direct substitutions and basic operations involving functions and successfully determines the constant of proportionality in direct proportion scenarios.",
    "weakness": "The student consistently struggles with finding the correct inverse of functions and incorrectly applies the properties of increasing and concave up functions to the estimation of sums, and misunderstands the calculation of distances from points to geometric shapes, leading to incorrect answers. It has difficulty applying functions correctly in nested or iterative scenarios, often leading to incorrect results or misinterpretations of function compositions."
  },
  "Geometric Reasoning": {
    "overview": "Evaluates the student's ability to reason with geometric properties and relationships.",
