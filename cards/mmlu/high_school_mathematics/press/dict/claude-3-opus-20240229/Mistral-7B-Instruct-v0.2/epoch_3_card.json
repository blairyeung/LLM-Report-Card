  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates inconsistent algebraic manipulation skills, ranging from reasonable proficiency to having difficulty with more complex manipulations.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It attempts to methodically apply algebraic techniques like isolating variables, using logarithm properties, and completing the square, but sometimes uses flawed logic, skips important steps, or loses track in complex problems.",
    "strength": "The student is able to correctly set up some equations from word problems, apply logarithm properties in certain cases, and complete the square to analyze equations of circles.",
    "weakness": "It makes errors when factoring, distributing terms, solving for variables, and recognizing when an equation has no real solution due to constraints, especially in more involved algebraic manipulations like those involving nested functions. For example, it incorrectly simplifies the expression for an inverse function."
  },
  "Geometric Reasoning Ability": {
    "overview": "The student shows some ability to reason about geometric relationships, but exhibits inconsistency, lacks precision, and does not always apply principles correctly.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It considers relevant geometric principles like triangle inequality, but does not always apply them correctly or thoroughly.",
    "strength": "",
    "weakness": "In a triangle side lengths problem, the student incorrectly concludes that one option is impossible, failing to notice it actually satisfies the triangle inequality."
  },
  "Calculus Concepts Understanding": {
    "overview": "The student attempts to apply calculus concepts like concavity and integration, but makes significant conceptual errors in connecting function properties to Riemann sums.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It tries to connect function properties to relationships between Riemann sums, but the reasoning is flawed and imprecise.",
    "strength": "",
    "weakness": "The student incorrectly claims concave up implies the midpoint lies between left and right Riemann sums. It also confuses trapezoid sums with non-existent rectangle sums."
  },
  "Data Analysis Skills": {
    "overview": "The student shows very limited ability to analyze data and extract relevant insights to solve problems.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It attempts to walk through the given information step-by-step but fails to synthesize the key facts needed to reach the solution. The student's approach is unfocused.",
    "strength": "",
    "weakness": "In a problem about finding a number given means, the student is unable to set up the equations properly using the supplied data. It reaches an impasse, concluding the question is unsolvable."
  },
  "Theorem Application Knowledge": {
    "overview": "The student attempts to apply some number theory concepts, but often does so incorrectly by using them in the wrong contexts or making conceptual errors.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It tries to use ideas like the Binomial theorem and prime factorization, but applies them in the wrong contexts or makes conceptual errors.",
    "strength": "",
    "weakness": "The student incorrectly uses the Binomial theorem modulo a prime to find the remainder of a large power. It also doesn't fully grasp the relationship between a number's prime factors and its factors."
  },
  "Logical Reasoning": {
    "overview": "The student exhibits inconsistent logical reasoning abilities across different problem types. Its thinking is error-prone, often failing to fully solve problems or consider all possibilities.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It attempts to reason through problems step-by-step, use variables for unknowns, and make logical deductions based on given information, but frequently introduces flawed logic, irrelevant considerations, incomplete reasoning, or fails to consider all scenarios, leading to contradictions, invalid conclusions, or premature judgments.",
    "strength": "The student demonstrates some ability to break down problems into steps, consider different scenarios, set up equations to represent constraints in word problems, and draw some reasonable logical conclusions.",
    "weakness": "However, the student's reasoning is often flawed and it fails to identify or correct obvious logical inconsistencies. It sometimes reaches conclusions that don't follow from the information given. A tendency to latch onto a plausible line of reasoning without exhaustively considering other possibilities leads the student to premature and incorrect conclusions in tricky problems."
  },
  "Probability Concepts Understanding": {
    "overview": "The student shows a partial understanding of basic probability concepts, but makes significant errors in applying them, especially in tricky scenarios requiring deeper insights.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It attempts to use concepts like total probability and conditional probability and approaches probability problems in a structured way by identifying the sample space and key events, but sometimes applies concepts incorrectly.",
    "strength": "The student has an overall accurate understanding of how probability works for independent events.",
    "weakness": "The student confuses the concepts of conditional probability and probability of simultaneous events, leading to incorrect solutions. Edge cases and tricky probability questions that require carefully considering multiple events trip the student up and lead to flawed reasoning."
  },
  "Arithmetic Skills": {
    "overview": "The student is generally capable of performing arithmetic operations to calculate quantities based on described scenarios, but makes occasional errors.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It can add, subtract, multiply and divide to calculate quantities based on described scenarios and attempts to break down calculations into steps, but sometimes loses track or makes computational mistakes.",
    "strength": "The student is generally able to set up the correct arithmetic operations to solve problems and correctly calculates the sum and mean of a set of numbers.",
    "weakness": "Careless errors in arithmetic lead the student to incorrect answers in some cases, even when the problem solving approach is sound. It makes a rounding error in selecting between the multiple choice options for the mean value."

  "Number Sense": {
    "overview": "The student shows basic number sense, understanding ideas like factors and multiples at a surface level, but sometimes struggles to reason about them conceptually.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It understands ideas like factors and multiples at a surface level, but struggles to reason about them conceptually.",
    "strength": "The student correctly identifies that finding the smallest integer with certain factors requires calculating the least common multiple.",
    "weakness": "It doesn't fully grasp when quantities can be factored or the relationships between a number's factors."
