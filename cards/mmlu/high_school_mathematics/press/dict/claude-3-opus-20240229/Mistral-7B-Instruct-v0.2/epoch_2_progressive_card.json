{
  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates some ability to manipulate algebraic expressions, but makes errors in certain steps.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It attempts to set up equations and solve for variables, but sometimes uses faulty logic or skips important steps.",
    "strength": "The student is able to correctly set up some equations from word problems, like recognizing direct proportionality relationships.",
    "weakness": "It makes algebraic mistakes like not distributing multiplication properly, and sometimes draws invalid conclusions from intermediate results."
  },
  "Theorem Application Knowledge": {
    "overview": "The student attempts to apply some number theory concepts, but does so incorrectly in most cases.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It tries to use ideas like the Binomial theorem and prime factorization, but applies them in the wrong contexts or makes conceptual errors.",
    "strength": "",
    "weakness": "The student incorrectly uses the Binomial theorem modulo a prime to find the remainder of a large power. It also doesn't fully grasp the relationship between a number's prime factors and its factors."
  },
  "Logical Reasoning": {
    "overview": "The student's reasoning is inconsistent and contains logical flaws.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It sometimes reaches conclusions that don't follow from the given information. It eliminates answer choices through faulty logic.",
    "strength": "",
    "weakness": "The student concludes a smallest positive integer doesn't exist based on limited checking, when more exhaustive checking is required. It uses approximate relationships to make exact inferences."
  },
  "Arithmetic Skills": {
    "overview": "The student is generally capable of performing arithmetic operations.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It can add, subtract, multiply and divide to calculate quantities based on described scenarios.",
    "strength": "The student correctly calculates the sum and mean of a set of numbers.",
    "weakness": "It makes a rounding error in selecting between the multiple choice options for the mean value."
  },
  "Number Sense": {
    "overview": "The student shows basic number sense, but sometimes doesn't grasp deeper concepts.",
    "thinking_pattern": "It understands ideas like factors and multiples at a surface level, but struggles to reason about them conceptually.",
    "strength": "The student correctly identifies that finding the smallest integer with certain factors requires calculating the least common multiple.",
    "weakness": "It doesn't fully grasp when quantities can be factored or the relationships between a number's factors."
