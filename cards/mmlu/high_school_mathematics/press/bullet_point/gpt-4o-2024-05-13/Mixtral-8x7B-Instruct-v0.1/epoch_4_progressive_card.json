{
  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": "The student struggles with algebraic manipulation, particularly in understanding and applying the correct operations for problem-solving. In the first question, it incorrectly calculated the number of days and misunderstood the direction of counting days, leading to an incorrect day of the week. In the third question, it failed to correctly adjust the period of the function when transformed by a scale factor, showing a fundamental misunderstanding of how transformations affect the periodicity of functions.",
  "Geometric Reasoning Ability": "The student demonstrated a correct understanding of geometric transformations, specifically reflections across a line. It correctly identified the new coordinates of a pentagon's vertices after reflection across the line y = x, indicating a solid grasp of this aspect of geometry.",
  "Calculus Concepts Understanding": "",
  "Data Analysis Skills": "The student correctly performed basic arithmetic operations needed for data aggregation in the bird feed problem, showing competence in handling straightforward addition tasks within a practical context.",
  "Theorem Application Knowledge": "It shows a lack of understanding in applying theorems or mathematical properties correctly, particularly in the factorization and period transformation problems. It incorrectly applied the concept of common factors and the effect of scaling on the period of a function.",
  "Conceptual Understanding of Factorials and Combinations": "",
  "Periodic Function Analysis": "The student has a weak understanding of periodic functions and their transformations. It incorrectly concluded that the period of a scaled function is reduced by the same factor as the scaling, which is a fundamental error in understanding how function transformations affect periodicity."
