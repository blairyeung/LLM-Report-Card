{
  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": "The student shows a mixed ability in algebraic manipulation. It correctly applied the concept of least common multiple (LCM) in determining the smallest positive integer with given factors, demonstrating a strong grasp of prime factorization and multiplication of highest powers. However, it struggled with exponentiation and modular arithmetic, as seen in the incorrect calculation of the remainder of a large power divided by a prime number.",
  "Geometric Reasoning Ability": "",
  "Calculus Concepts Understanding": "",
  "Data Analysis Skills": "The student accurately calculated the mean of a set of numbers, indicating a solid understanding of basic statistical operations such as summation and division.",
  "Theorem Application Knowledge": "It demonstrated a correct application of theorems related to number theory, particularly in identifying factors and multiples. However, it incorrectly applied reasoning in the context of divisor products leading to a specific power of a number, suggesting a misunderstanding or misapplication of the relevant theorems.",
  "Conceptual Understanding of Factorials and Combinations": "",
  "Understanding of Proportional Relationships": "The student correctly solved a problem involving direct proportionality, indicating a good understanding of the concept and its application in solving for unknown variables using the constant of proportionality."
