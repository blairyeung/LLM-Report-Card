{
  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": "The student shows a mixed ability in algebraic manipulation. It correctly applies algebraic principles in some instances, such as finding the least common multiple and solving for variables in direct proportion problems. However, it struggles with correct application in more complex scenarios, such as misapplying Fermat's Little Theorem and incorrectly calculating the smallest integer with given factors in one instance.",
  "Geometric Reasoning Ability": "",
  "Calculus Concepts Understanding": "",
  "Data Analysis Skills": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of data analysis, as seen in calculating the mean of a set of scores. However, it makes rounding errors that lead to incorrect conclusions, suggesting a need for more precision in handling numerical data.",
  "Theorem Application Knowledge": "The student attempts to apply mathematical theorems such as Fermat's Little Theorem but does so incorrectly, leading to an incorrect conclusion about remainders in modular arithmetic. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding or misapplication of the theorem's conditions and results.",
  "Factorization and Simplification Skills": "The student shows an understanding of factorization in the context of identifying factors of a number given its prime factors. However, it incorrectly identifies necessary factors, indicating a misunderstanding of how factors are derived from prime factorizations."
