{
  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": "The student shows a basic understanding of algebraic manipulation but struggles with accuracy and the application of correct algebraic principles in complex scenarios. For instance, it incorrectly calculated the total number of days in a leap year scenario and failed to correctly apply transformations in a function shifting problem.",
  "Geometric Reasoning Ability": "The student demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of geometric transformations, particularly in reflecting points across a line. It incorrectly identified the new coordinates of a point after reflection, indicating a lack of comprehension in how to apply geometric transformations accurately.",
  "Calculus Concepts Understanding": "There is no direct evidence from the responses to assess the student's understanding of calculus concepts.",
  "Data Analysis Skills": "The student struggles with basic arithmetic operations and data aggregation, as seen in the incorrect summation of quantities and failure to account for initial conditions in a problem involving cumulative totals.",
  "Theorem Application Knowledge": "The student has shown an ability to identify relevant theorems or mathematical properties, such as factorization, but it misapplies these concepts leading to incorrect conclusions, as seen in the factorization of numbers and the analysis of probabilities.",
  "Factorization and Simplification Skills": "The student can identify factors of numbers but struggles with the correct application of these factors in broader mathematical contexts, leading to incorrect answers in problems requiring deeper analysis of factor relationships.",
  "Probability Calculation Proficiency": "The student demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of probability calculations, particularly in scenarios involving dependent events. It incorrectly assumes independence in sequential draws from a finite set without replacement, leading to erroneous probability calculations."
