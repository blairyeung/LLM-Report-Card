{
  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": "The student shows a mixed ability in algebraic manipulation. It correctly solved problems involving basic algebraic operations and factorials, as seen in the computation of 4-digit integers with odd digits. However, it made errors in more complex scenarios such as finding the inverse of functions and calculating combinations, indicating a lack of depth in understanding algebraic expressions and their manipulations.",
  "Geometric Reasoning Ability": "",
  "Calculus Concepts Understanding": "",
  "Data Analysis Skills": "The student demonstrated a good grasp of basic statistical concepts, correctly calculating the impact of an additional number on the mean of a dataset. This indicates a solid understanding of how to manipulate and interpret numerical data within a given context.",
  "Theorem Application Knowledge": "",
  "Factorization and Simplification Skills": "The student struggles with factorization and simplification, particularly in identifying and working with factors of factorial expressions and exponential equations. This was evident in the incorrect identification of the largest odd factor of 5! and misunderstanding the manipulation of exponents in logarithmic equations."
