{
  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": "The student demonstrates strong algebraic manipulation skills, correctly applying theorems and simplifying expressions in most cases. However, it made a critical error in the application of Fermat's Little Theorem, leading to an incorrect conclusion about the remainder of 25^1059 divided by 23. This indicates a misunderstanding or misapplication of the theorem in specific contexts.",
  "Geometric Reasoning Ability": "",
  "Calculus Concepts Understanding": "",
  "Data Analysis Skills": "The student shows proficiency in basic data analysis, correctly calculating mean scores from a set of data. However, it struggles with more complex data analysis involving the determination of the number of possible sequences that meet a given condition, as seen in the arithmetic sequence problem.",
  "Theorem Application Knowledge": "The student generally applies mathematical theorems correctly, such as using prime factorization to determine LCM and factors. However, it incorrectly applied Fermat's Little Theorem in one instance, suggesting a need for deeper understanding or careful application in non-standard problems."
