  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": "The student demonstrates strong algebraic manipulation skills across various contexts, including solving equations involving linear, quadratic, and exponential forms, and simplifying expressions. It successfully isolates variables and applies methods such as completing the square and equating exponents. However, it has shown inconsistencies, particularly in handling inverse functions, Fermat's Little Theorem, and complex transformations, indicating occasional misunderstandings or misapplications in specific contexts.",
  "Geometric Reasoning Ability": "The student shows proficiency in geometric reasoning, accurately applying concepts such as the triangle inequality theorem and completing the square to determine geometric properties like the center and radius of a circle. It also demonstrates a solid grasp of geometric transformations, such as reflecting points across a line. However, it has made errors, such as incorrectly identifying scenarios involving degenerate triangles, suggesting occasional misunderstandings of strict inequalities and geometric conditions.",
  "Calculus Concepts Understanding": "The student struggles with calculus concepts, particularly in understanding the relationships between different Riemann sums for functions that are increasing and concave up. It incorrectly ranks the sums, showing a fundamental misunderstanding of how the properties of the function affect the estimates provided by left, right, midpoint, and trapezoidal sums.",
  "Data Analysis Skills": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic data analysis tasks, such as calculating means and handling problems involving conditional probabilities and the complement rule. However, it struggles with more complex data analysis, such as determining the number of possible sequences that meet a given condition, indicating a need for improvement in handling complex numerical data.",
  "Theorem Application Knowledge": "The student generally applies mathematical theorems correctly in various contexts, including combinatorics, properties of exponents, and prime factorization. However, it shows lapses in execution and occasional errors, such as in applying Fermat's Little Theorem and periodic function properties, suggesting a need for deeper understanding or careful application in non-standard problems.",
  "Combinatorial Reasoning": "The student adeptly handles probability problems involving multiple events, using concepts such as complementary probability to find solutions. This indicates strong combinatorial reasoning skills."
