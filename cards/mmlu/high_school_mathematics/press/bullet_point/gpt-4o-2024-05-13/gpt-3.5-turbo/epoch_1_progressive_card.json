{
  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": "The student demonstrates a strong ability in algebraic manipulation, correctly solving equations involving both linear and quadratic forms. It successfully isolates variables and simplifies expressions to find solutions, as seen in the problems involving the product of integers and solving for x in exponential equations.",
  "Geometric Reasoning Ability": "The student shows proficiency in geometric reasoning, correctly applying the triangle inequality theorem and completing the square to find the center and radius of a circle. However, it incorrectly identifies a degenerate triangle scenario, suggesting a misunderstanding of the strict inequality required by the triangle inequality theorem.",
  "Calculus Concepts Understanding": "The student struggles with calculus concepts, particularly in understanding the relationships between different Riemann sums for functions that are increasing and concave up. It incorrectly ranks the sums, showing a fundamental misunderstanding of how the properties of the function affect the estimates provided by left, right, midpoint, and trapezoidal sums.",
  "Data Analysis Skills": "The student correctly applies probability concepts to solve problems involving conditional probabilities and the use of the complement rule. It demonstrates a clear understanding of how to manipulate probabilities to find the likelihood of combined events.",
  "Theorem Application Knowledge": "The student effectively uses theorems and mathematical properties in various contexts, such as applying the triangle inequality theorem and using properties of exponents to solve equations. However, it shows a lapse in applying the triangle inequality theorem correctly in the context of a degenerate triangle."
