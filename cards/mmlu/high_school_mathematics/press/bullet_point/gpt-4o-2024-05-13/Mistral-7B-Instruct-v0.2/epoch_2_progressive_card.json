{
  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": "The student struggles with algebraic manipulation, particularly in simplifying expressions and solving equations correctly. For example, in the problem involving finding the remainder of a large exponentiation modulo a prime, the student incorrectly applies the binomial theorem and misinterprets the calculation of binomial coefficients, leading to an incorrect answer. Similarly, in the LCM calculation, the student fails to correctly identify the highest powers of prime factors, resulting in incorrect LCM values.",
  "Geometric Reasoning Ability": "",
  "Calculus Concepts Understanding": "",
  "Data Analysis Skills": "The student shows a lack of precision in data analysis, as seen in the calculation of the mean score from a set of numbers. The student incorrectly rounds off the mean score and fails to match it with the correct answer choice, indicating a misunderstanding of basic statistical calculations.",
  "Theorem Application Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a misunderstanding in the application of mathematical theorems and properties. For instance, the use of the binomial theorem in the context of modular arithmetic is incorrectly executed, leading to an erroneous conclusion. Additionally, the student's attempt to apply properties of arithmetic sequences and LCM calculations further illustrates a lack of proper theorem application.",
  "Conceptual Understanding of Factorials and Combinatorics": "",
  "Problem Interpretation Skills": "The student often misinterprets the requirements of the problems, leading to incorrect approaches and solutions. For example, in the problem about finding a number's factors, the student incorrectly identifies the factors due to a misinterpretation of the prime factors listed. This recurring issue suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of problem statements and their implications."
