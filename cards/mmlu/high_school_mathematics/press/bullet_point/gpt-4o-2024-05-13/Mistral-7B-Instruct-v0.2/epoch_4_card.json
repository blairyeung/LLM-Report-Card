{
  "Algebraic Manipulation Proficiency": "The student demonstrates inconsistent proficiency in algebraic manipulation. It shows some ability to isolate variables and solve equations, as seen in specific problems, but struggles with applying algebraic principles correctly across different contexts. Common errors include incorrect application of logarithmic transformations, simplification of expressions, and misinterpretation of modulo operations. These issues lead to incorrect conclusions in both simple and complex algebraic problems.",
  "Geometric Reasoning Ability": "The student has a basic to reasonable understanding of geometric concepts, capable of applying formulas such as the distance formula correctly. However, it often misapplies concepts, particularly in more complex scenarios like completing the square or understanding triangle side lengths conditions. This indicates a superficial grasp of geometric reasoning, leading to errors in identifying correct geometric properties such as the circle's center and radius.",
  "Calculus Concepts Understanding": "The student struggles significantly with calculus concepts, especially in understanding the relationships between different Riemann sums and the implications of functions' properties on these sums. It often reaches incorrect conclusions that do not match provided answer options, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of calculus principles.",
  "Data Analysis Skills": "The student shows a lack of proficiency and precision in data analysis and handling statistical concepts. Common errors include incorrect calculations of means, misunderstandings in the application of probability principles, and misinterpretation of statistical implications, such as the impact of additional data points on mean values and probability of simultaneous events.",
  "Theorem Application Knowledge": "The student inconsistently applies mathematical theorems and principles. While occasionally using formulas correctly, such as the distance formula, it frequently misapplies or misunderstands theorems like the binomial theorem, triangle inequality, and properties of logarithms. This leads to incorrect answers and a fundamental misunderstanding of how to apply mathematical properties correctly.",
  "Conceptual Understanding of Factorials and Combinatorics": "The student shows a significant misunderstanding of factorials, combinatorics, and related concepts such as Pascal's Triangle. It often incorrectly states prime factorizations, misunderstands combinatorial principles, and makes errors in calculating probabilities involving sequences of events. These issues indicate a fundamental confusion about combinatorial calculations and their applications.",
  "Problem Interpretation Skills": "The student often misinterprets the requirements of problems, leading to incorrect approaches and solutions. This recurring issue suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of problem statements and their implications, affecting its ability to correctly identify factors and apply appropriate mathematical methods."
