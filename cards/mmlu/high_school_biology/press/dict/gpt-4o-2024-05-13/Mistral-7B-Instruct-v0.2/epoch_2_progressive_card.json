  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures and their functions.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently applies knowledge of cellular structures to explain biological processes.",
    "strength": "Accurately identifies the role of mitotic cell divisions in actively growing tissues and correctly explains the process of diffusion across the plasma membrane.",

  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": {
    "overview": "The student shows a good grasp of genetic mechanisms and inheritance patterns.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student uses logical reasoning and Punnett squares to deduce inheritance patterns.",
    "strength": "Correctly identifies memory cells' role in immune response and explains incomplete dominance in chicken feather color inheritance.",
    "weakness": "Incorrectly assumes that genetic changes can only occur at the population level, showing a misunderstanding of individual versus population-level evolution."
