  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": {
    "overview": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of genetic mechanisms, particularly in the context of genetic variation and mutation.",
    "thinking_pattern": "The student consistently identifies the correct sources of genetic variation and accurately explains the role of mutations.",
    "strength": "The student correctly identifies the reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction as the chief cause of genetic variation and accurately explains the role of mutations in creating new phenotypes.",
