{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures and their functions. It correctly identifies the location of the Krebs cycle in the mitochondrial matrix and accurately explains the role of ATP synthase in cellular respiration.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a strong grasp of genetic mechanisms. It correctly identifies the reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction as the primary cause of genetic variation and understands the role of mutations in generating new phenotypes. However, it incorrectly states that all genetic variation produces phenotypic variation, indicating a slight misunderstanding in this area.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student exhibits a misunderstanding in ecological systems, particularly in identifying the critical factor responsible for the shift from forest ecosystems to grasslands. It incorrectly attributes this shift to the amount of sunlight rather than the availability of water.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student demonstrates a thorough understanding of physiological processes, particularly in cellular respiration. It correctly identifies the coupling of endergonic and exergonic reactions in ATP formation and accurately explains the role of the citric acid cycle in CO2 production.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student shows a strong understanding of evolutionary biology concepts. It correctly identifies the principles of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes, and the role of mutations in generating genetic variation."
