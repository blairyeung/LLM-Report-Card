  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures and their functions. It correctly identifies and explains various cellular processes, including the endosymbiotic theory, the role of restriction enzymes like EcoR1, the location of the Krebs cycle in the mitochondrial matrix, and the role of ATP synthase in cellular respiration. However, it shows some confusion in the context of protein synthesis, particularly in recognizing the importance of mRNA degradation.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a strong grasp of genetic mechanisms, accurately explaining concepts such as genetic drift, the migration of DNA fragments during gel electrophoresis, the reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction, and the role of mutations in generating new phenotypes. It also understands incomplete dominance in inheritance patterns and the role of phagocytes in invertebrate immune systems. However, it incorrectly states that all genetic variation produces phenotypic variation and shows a misunderstanding of neuronal processes and the evolutionary unit.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of ecological systems, correctly identifying concepts such as intraspecific competition, biotic factors affecting population growth, the benefits of natural wildfires, the characteristics of the tundra biome, and the transmission methods of mosquito-borne diseases. However, it exhibits a misunderstanding in identifying the critical factor responsible for the shift from forest ecosystems to grasslands.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student displays a thorough understanding of physiological processes, correctly explaining principles such as osmosis, the metabolic activity in germinating seeds, the coupling of endergonic and exergonic reactions in ATP formation, the role of the citric acid cycle in CO2 production, and the role of ADH in maintaining homeostasis. It also understands the role of memory cells in rapid immune response and diffusion in cellular membranes. However, it shows some confusion in the context of protein synthesis and neuron membrane potential changes.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student demonstrates a strong grasp of evolutionary biology concepts, correctly identifying and explaining stabilizing selection, Darwin's theory of common ancestry, the impact of genetic drift in small populations, the principles of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes, and the role of mutations in generating genetic variation. It also understands biogeography and the significance of the Galapagos Islands to Darwin's theory. However, it incorrectly states that Darwin would not reject the idea that the smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism and shows a gap in understanding X chromosome inactivation.",
  "Biogeochemical Cycles Knowledge": "The student shows a misunderstanding of biogeochemical cycles, incorrectly reasoning that all cycles involve gaseous phases and failing to identify the phosphorus cycle as generally absent from a gas phase."
