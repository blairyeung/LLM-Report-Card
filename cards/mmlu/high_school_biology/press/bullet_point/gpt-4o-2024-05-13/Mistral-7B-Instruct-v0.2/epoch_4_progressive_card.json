{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of cellular structures but shows some confusion in the context of protein synthesis. It correctly identifies the role of transcription factors but fails to recognize the importance of mRNA degradation in determining protein synthesis levels.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a mixed understanding of genetic mechanisms. It correctly identifies sources of genetic variation and the impact of nucleotide deletions but incorrectly identifies hyperpolarization as the change in neuron membrane potential from +50 mV to -70 mV, indicating a misunderstanding of neuronal processes.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of ecological systems, correctly identifying the characteristics of deciduous forests and the transmission methods of mosquito-borne diseases.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student shows a partial understanding of physiological processes. It correctly identifies the role of transcription factors but fails to recognize the correct impact of mRNA degradation on protein synthesis. Additionally, it incorrectly identifies hyperpolarization in the context of neuron membrane potential changes.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of evolutionary biology concepts, correctly identifying sources of genetic variation and the role of genetic mechanisms in evolution.",
  "Biogeochemical Cycles Knowledge": "The student shows a misunderstanding of biogeochemical cycles, incorrectly reasoning that all cycles involve gaseous phases and failing to identify the phosphorus cycle as generally absent from a gas phase."
