{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures and their functions, particularly in the context of mitotic cell divisions and diffusion across the plasma membrane. It correctly identifies the shoot tip as a site of active mitosis and explains the role of concentration gradients in diffusion.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a strong grasp of genetic mechanisms, accurately explaining concepts such as memory cells in the immune response, incomplete dominance in inheritance patterns, and the role of phagocytes in invertebrate immune systems. However, it incorrectly interprets the evolutionary unit, suggesting that genetic changes can only occur at the population level.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student correctly identifies the role of memory cells in rapid immune response and explains the process of diffusion in cellular membranes, indicating a good understanding of physiological processes.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of biogeography and Darwin's theory of evolution, correctly identifying the role of environmental change and inherited variation in natural selection. However, it incorrectly states that Darwin would not reject the idea that the smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism."
