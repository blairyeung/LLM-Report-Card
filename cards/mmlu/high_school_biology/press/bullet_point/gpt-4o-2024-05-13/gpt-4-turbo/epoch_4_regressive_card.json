  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures and their functions. It correctly identifies the endosymbiotic theory, the role of restriction enzymes like EcoR1, the location of the Krebs cycle within the mitochondrial matrix, the site of mitotic cell divisions, and the role of phagocytes in invertebrate immune systems. It also accurately explains the role of ATP synthase in cellular respiration and the role of mitochondria in both plants and animals.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a strong grasp of genetic mechanisms, accurately explaining concepts such as gel electrophoresis, genetic drift, the reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction, nucleotide variability, polyploidy, incomplete dominance, memory cells in immune response, inheritance patterns in chickens, X-chromosome inactivation, fixed loci, ADH in homeostasis, frameshift mutations, mRNA degradation, and the sources and implications of genetic variations.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student exhibits a clear understanding of ecological systems, correctly identifying intraspecific competition, biotic factors affecting population growth, water availability's impact on ecosystem shifts, the benefits of natural wildfires, the characteristics of the tundra biome, the ecological roles and adaptations of organisms, the characteristics of different biomes, and the transmission methods of various diseases.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student demonstrates a thorough understanding of physiological processes, correctly explaining the relationship between transpiration and air movement, oxygen consumption of germinating seeds, the coupling of endergonic and exergonic reactions in ATP formation, cellular respiration, factors influencing the rate of diffusion across a plasma membrane, immune response to repeated pathogen exposure, ADH's role in water retention, Barr bodies in X-chromosome inactivation, the role of the appendix in the immune system, stages of neuron membrane potential changes, and the properties and roles of lipids in biological systems.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student has a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary biology concepts, accurately explaining stabilizing selection, the relationship between related organisms and their common ancestors, principles of natural selection, Darwin's theory of evolution, mechanisms of genetic variation, modern views on evolution, the population as the unit of evolution, homologous structures, the importance of the Galapagos Islands in Darwin's theory, the evolutionary significance of various biological traits and structures, biogeochemical cycles, and the absence of a gas phase in the phosphorus cycle."
