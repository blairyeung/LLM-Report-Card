{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of cellular structures and their functions. It correctly identifies the location of the Krebs cycle within the mitochondrial matrix and accurately explains the role of ATP synthase in cellular respiration.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a solid grasp of genetic mechanisms, correctly identifying the reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction as the chief cause of genetic variation and understanding the role of nucleotide variability in producing new alleles. It also correctly identifies polyploidy as a cause of reproductive isolation in plants.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student accurately identifies water availability as the critical factor responsible for the shift from forest ecosystems to grasslands, demonstrating a good understanding of ecological principles.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student exhibits a strong understanding of physiological processes, correctly explaining the coupling of endergonic and exergonic reactions in ATP formation and identifying the correct statements about cellular respiration.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student shows a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary biology concepts, correctly identifying principles of Darwin's theory of evolution, the role of natural selection, and the mechanisms of genetic variation. It also accurately summarizes modern views on evolution."
