{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures and their functions. It correctly identifies the role of phagocytes in invertebrate immune systems and understands the factors affecting the rate of diffusion across the plasma membrane.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a good grasp of genetic mechanisms, correctly identifying memory cells' role in immune response and understanding the concept of populations as evolutionary units. However, it incorrectly identifies the inheritance pattern in chickens, suggesting a need for improvement in understanding genetic dominance and epistasis.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of physiological processes, particularly in the context of immune responses and diffusion mechanisms.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student has a robust understanding of evolutionary biology concepts, correctly identifying biogeography and the role of populations in evolution. It also accurately interprets Darwin's views on evolution and natural selection."
