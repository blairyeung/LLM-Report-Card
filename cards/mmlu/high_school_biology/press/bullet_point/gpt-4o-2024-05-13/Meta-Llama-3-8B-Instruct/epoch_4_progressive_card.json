{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures and their functions. It correctly identifies the role of transcription factors in gene expression but fails to recognize the importance of mRNA degradation in protein synthesis.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a mixed understanding of genetic mechanisms. It correctly identifies the impact of frameshift mutations but incorrectly assesses the consequences of nucleotide deletions and substitutions. It also misunderstands the sources of genetic variation, incorrectly identifying recombination at fertilization as not a source of variation.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student accurately identifies the characteristics of different biomes, such as deciduous forests, and correctly understands the transmission methods of diseases like Zika fever, West Nile fever, and malaria.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student demonstrates a misunderstanding of neuron membrane potential changes, incorrectly identifying hyperpolarization instead of repolarization. It also shows confusion regarding the properties of lipids, incorrectly stating that none of the provided options are correct.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student shows a good grasp of evolutionary biology concepts, correctly identifying the sources of genetic variation and the role of biogeochemical cycles, such as the phosphorus cycle, in ecosystems."
