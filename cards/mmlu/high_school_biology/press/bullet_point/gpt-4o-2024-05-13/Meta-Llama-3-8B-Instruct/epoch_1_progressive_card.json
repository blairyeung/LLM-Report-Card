{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of cellular structures and their functions. It correctly identifies the mitochondrial matrix as the site of the Krebs cycle and accurately explains the role of the inner mitochondrial membrane in the electron transport chain.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a solid grasp of genetic mechanisms. It correctly identifies mutation as the cause of new variants and understands the role of reshuffling alleles in sexual reproduction as the primary source of genetic variation. It also accurately explains that not all genetic variation results in phenotypic variation and that new alleles arise from nucleotide variability.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student exhibits a misunderstanding in ecological systems, particularly in identifying the critical factor responsible for the shift from forest to grasslands. It incorrectly attributes this shift to the amount of sunlight rather than the availability of water.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of physiological processes. It correctly identifies the coupling of endergonic and exergonic reactions in ATP formation during cellular respiration and accurately explains the stages of cellular respiration, including the role of the citric acid cycle in CO2 production.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student shows a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary biology concepts. It correctly identifies the principles of Darwin's theory of evolution, the role of differential survival and reproduction in evolution, and the sources of genetic variation. It also accurately explains the limitations of acquired characteristics and gene flow in the context of evolution."
