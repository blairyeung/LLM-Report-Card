{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures and their functions. It correctly identifies the location of the Krebs cycle within the mitochondrial matrix and accurately explains the process of ATP formation in cellular respiration.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a strong grasp of genetic mechanisms. It correctly identifies the reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction as the chief cause of genetic variation and accurately explains the role of mutations in creating new variants. However, it incorrectly states that all phenotypic variation is the result of genotypic variation, overlooking environmental influences.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of ecological systems, correctly identifying the availability of water as the critical factor responsible for the shift from forest ecosystems to grasslands.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student exhibits a thorough understanding of physiological processes, accurately explaining the principles of cellular respiration and the Krebs cycle.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student has a strong grasp of evolutionary biology concepts. It correctly identifies the principles of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and accurately explains the modern view of evolution as the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes."
