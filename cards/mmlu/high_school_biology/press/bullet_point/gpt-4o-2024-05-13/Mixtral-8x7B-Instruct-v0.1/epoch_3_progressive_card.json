{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures, as evidenced by correctly identifying the role of mitochondria in both plant and animal cells. However, the student incorrectly identified mitochondria as analogous rather than homologous structures, indicating a minor gap in understanding evolutionary relationships at the cellular level.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a strong grasp of genetic mechanisms, accurately explaining concepts such as X-inactivation and the formation of Barr bodies. The student also correctly identified the relationship between fixed loci and genetic variability, demonstrating a clear understanding of genetic diversity and its implications.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student exhibits a good understanding of ecological systems, correctly identifying the benefits of natural wildfires and the characteristics of the tundra biome. The explanations provided are thorough and demonstrate a clear grasp of ecological principles and their applications.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student has a strong understanding of physiological processes, as shown by correctly identifying the role of ADH in maintaining homeostasis. The student\u2019s reasoning is clear and accurately describes the mechanisms involved in water regulation and homeostasis.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of evolutionary biology concepts, correctly identifying the significance of the Galapagos Islands in Darwin's theory of natural selection and the concept of homology. However, there was a minor error in identifying the homology of mitochondria, suggesting a need for a slight improvement in understanding evolutionary relationships."
