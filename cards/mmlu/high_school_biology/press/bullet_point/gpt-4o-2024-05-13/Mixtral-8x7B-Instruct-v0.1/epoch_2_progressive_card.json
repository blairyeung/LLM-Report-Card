{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a basic understanding of cellular structures and processes, such as mitotic cell division. However, it incorrectly identified the site of mitotic cell divisions, indicating a need for deeper comprehension of where these processes occur in different tissues.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a good grasp of genetic mechanisms, particularly in the context of immune response and inheritance patterns. It correctly identified memory cells' role in rapid recovery from a second infection and explained the concept of incomplete dominance in genetic inheritance, although it incorrectly identified codominance in one instance.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student has a solid understanding of physiological processes, as evidenced by its correct identification of factors affecting diffusion rates and the role of phagocytes in invertebrate immune systems.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of evolutionary biology concepts, correctly identifying biogeography as the field related to Darwin's observations and explaining why populations, not individuals, are the units of evolution. However, it incorrectly stated that genetic changes can only occur at the population level, showing a slight misunderstanding of the mechanisms of genetic change."
