{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a moderate understanding of cellular structures. It correctly identifies the role of transcription factors in gene expression but fails to recognize the importance of mRNA degradation in protein synthesis.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a good grasp of genetic mechanisms, correctly identifying sources of genetic variation and understanding the impact of nucleotide deletions and substitutions on protein synthesis. However, it incorrectly identifies a deletion of a nucleotide triplet as causing a frameshift, which is a significant error.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student has a strong understanding of ecological systems, correctly identifying the transmission methods of diseases and the characteristics of biomes. However, it incorrectly identifies the taiga as having trees that drop their leaves in winter.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student shows a weak understanding of physiological processes, incorrectly identifying hyperpolarization instead of repolarization in neuron membrane potential changes.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of evolutionary biology concepts, correctly identifying sources of genetic variation and the absence of a gas phase in the phosphorus cycle.",
  "Biochemical Processes Insight": "The student shows a moderate understanding of biochemical processes, correctly identifying the incorrect statements about lipids but failing to provide the correct answer from the given options."
