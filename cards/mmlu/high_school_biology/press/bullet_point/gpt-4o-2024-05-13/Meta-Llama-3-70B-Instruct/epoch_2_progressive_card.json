{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures and their functions. It correctly identifies regions of active mitotic cell division and understands the role of phagocytes in invertebrate immune systems.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a strong grasp of genetic principles, including incomplete dominance and the role of memory cells in the immune response. It accurately explains the inheritance of feather color in chickens and the rapid immune response to a second flu infection.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student effectively explains physiological processes such as diffusion across the plasma membrane and the role of concentration gradients. It also correctly identifies the role of memory cells in rapid immune responses.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student has a clear understanding of evolutionary biology concepts. It correctly identifies biogeography as the field explaining Darwin's observations and understands that populations, not individuals, evolve. It also accurately rejects Lamarckian inheritance in favor of Darwinian principles."
