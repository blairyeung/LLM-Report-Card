{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures and their functions. It correctly identifies the mitochondrial matrix as the site of the Krebs cycle and accurately explains the role of the inner mitochondrial membrane in the electron transport chain.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a strong grasp of genetic mechanisms, correctly identifying the reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction as the chief cause of genetic variation and understanding the role of nucleotide variability in producing new alleles. However, it incorrectly identifies polyploidy instead of mutation as the cause of a new variant in a population of ferns.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student accurately identifies the availability of water as the critical factor responsible for the shift from forest ecosystems to grasslands, demonstrating a good understanding of ecological principles.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student exhibits a thorough understanding of physiological processes, correctly identifying the coupling of endergonic and exergonic reactions in ATP formation during cellular respiration and accurately explaining the production of CO2 in the citric acid cycle.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student shows a strong understanding of evolutionary biology concepts, correctly identifying the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes as the best summary of evolution and accurately explaining the principles of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection."
