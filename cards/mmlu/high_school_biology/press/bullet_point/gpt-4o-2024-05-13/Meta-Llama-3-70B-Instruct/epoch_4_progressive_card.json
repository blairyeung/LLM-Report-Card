{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of genetic mechanisms, particularly in the context of mutations and their effects on protein synthesis. However, there is a notable error in the interpretation of hyperpolarization versus repolarization, indicating a need for deeper comprehension of neuron membrane potentials.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student shows a strong grasp of ecological systems, correctly identifying the characteristics of different biomes and the transmission methods of various diseases.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student has a good understanding of physiological processes, particularly in the context of protein synthesis and the factors affecting it. However, there is a significant error in the understanding of neuron membrane potential changes.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student accurately identifies sources of genetic variation and understands the role of genetic mutations in evolution. This indicates a strong grasp of evolutionary biology concepts.",
  "Biochemical Pathways Understanding": "The student demonstrates a clear understanding of biogeochemical cycles, correctly identifying the absence of a gas phase in the phosphorus cycle. However, there is a misunderstanding regarding the properties of lipids, indicating a need for further study in this area."
