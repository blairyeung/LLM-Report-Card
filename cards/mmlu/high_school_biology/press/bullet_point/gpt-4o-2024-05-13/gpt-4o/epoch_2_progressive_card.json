{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures and their functions. It correctly identifies the regions where mitotic cell division occurs and understands the role of phagocytes in the immune system of invertebrates.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a strong grasp of genetic mechanisms, including incomplete dominance and the role of memory cells in the immune response. It accurately explains the inheritance patterns in chickens and the rapid immune response due to memory cells.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student correctly identifies biogeography as the field explaining Darwin's observations about plant distribution, indicating a good understanding of ecological systems and species distribution.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student demonstrates a clear understanding of physiological processes, such as the factors affecting the rate of diffusion across cell membranes and the immune response mechanisms in vertebrates and invertebrates.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student has a strong grasp of evolutionary biology concepts. It correctly explains why populations are the units of evolution and identifies statements that Darwin would have rejected, showing a deep understanding of natural selection and evolutionary theory."
