{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures and their functions. It correctly identifies the mitochondrial matrix as the site of the Krebs cycle and understands the role of the inner mitochondrial membrane in the electron transport chain.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a strong grasp of genetic mechanisms. It correctly identifies the reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction as the chief cause of genetic variation and understands that new alleles arise from nucleotide variability. However, it incorrectly attributes the emergence of a new fern variant to polyploidy instead of mutation, indicating a need for deeper understanding of specific genetic changes.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student accurately identifies water availability as the critical factor responsible for the shift from forest ecosystems to grasslands, demonstrating a good understanding of ecological principles.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student exhibits a thorough understanding of physiological processes, correctly identifying the coupling of endergonic and exergonic reactions in ATP formation and the role of the Krebs cycle in cellular respiration.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student shows a strong understanding of evolutionary biology concepts. It correctly identifies the principle not part of Darwin's theory, the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes as the best summary of evolution, and the role of mutations in genetic variation. However, it needs to refine its understanding of the causes of reproductive isolation in new variants."
