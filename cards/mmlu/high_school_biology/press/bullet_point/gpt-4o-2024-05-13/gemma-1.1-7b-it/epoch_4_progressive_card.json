{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a partial understanding of cellular processes, as evidenced by its incorrect answer regarding the factors influencing protein synthesis. It correctly identifies the role of transcription factors but fails to recognize the importance of mRNA degradation.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a mixed understanding of genetic mechanisms. It correctly identifies sources of genetic variation and the impact of translation errors but incorrectly identifies the most deleterious mutation, showing a misunderstanding of frameshift mutations.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of ecological systems, correctly identifying the characteristics of deciduous forests and the transmission method of mosquito-borne diseases.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student shows a limited understanding of physiological processes, as evidenced by its incorrect identification of hyperpolarization and misunderstanding of lipid properties.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student correctly identifies sources of genetic variation and the absence of a gas phase in the phosphorus cycle, indicating a solid grasp of evolutionary biology concepts."
