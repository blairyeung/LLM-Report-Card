{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of genetic mechanisms, as evidenced by correctly identifying the significance of a Barr body and the implications of fixed loci on genetic variation. However, the student incorrectly identified the least likely pair of homologous structures, indicating a potential gap in understanding the concept of homology.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student shows a strong grasp of ecological systems, correctly identifying the benefits of natural wildfires and the characteristics of the tundra biome. This indicates a good understanding of how ecological processes and environmental factors influence ecosystems.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student accurately explains the role of ADH in maintaining homeostasis, demonstrating a clear understanding of physiological processes and the body's mechanisms for regulating internal conditions.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student exhibits a robust understanding of evolutionary biology concepts, correctly identifying the importance of the Galapagos Islands to Darwin's theory and the concept of convergent evolution. However, the student's reasoning about the appendix's vestigial nature was incorrect, suggesting a need for deeper comprehension of vestigial structures."
