{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular structures and their functions, as evidenced by correctly identifying the location of the Krebs cycle and the role of ATP synthase in cellular respiration.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a good grasp of genetic mechanisms, correctly identifying the reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction as the chief cause of genetic variation and recognizing mutation as a source of new phenotypes.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student exhibits a misunderstanding of ecological systems, incorrectly identifying the amount of sunlight as the critical factor for the shift from forest to grassland ecosystems, instead of the availability of water.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student accurately explains the coupling of endergonic and exergonic reactions in ATP formation during cellular respiration, indicating a strong understanding of physiological processes.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student shows a mixed understanding of evolutionary biology concepts. It correctly identifies natural selection as the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes but incorrectly states that overpopulation and competition are not fundamental principles of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection."
