{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of cellular processes, particularly mitosis and diffusion. It correctly identifies the shoot tip as a site of active mitotic cell division and explains the factors affecting the rate of diffusion of an uncharged solute across the plasma membrane.",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student shows a good grasp of genetic mechanisms, correctly identifying memory cells as responsible for rapid recovery from a second flu infection and understanding the role of phagocytes in invertebrate immune systems. However, it incorrectly identifies the inheritance pattern of feather color in chickens, suggesting a misunderstanding of epistasis versus incomplete dominance.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of evolutionary biology concepts. It correctly explains why populations, not individuals, are the units of evolution and accurately identifies biogeography as the field explaining Darwin's observations about plant similarities in different regions. It also correctly identifies a statement that Darwin would have rejected, showing a clear grasp of Darwinian principles."
