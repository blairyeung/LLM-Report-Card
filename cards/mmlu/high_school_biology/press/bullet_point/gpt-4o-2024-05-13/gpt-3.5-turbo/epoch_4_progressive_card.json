{
  "Cellular Structure Knowledge": "",
  "Genetic Mechanisms Understanding": "The student demonstrates a partial understanding of genetic mechanisms. It correctly identifies the role of transcription factors in gene expression but fails to recognize the importance of mRNA degradation in protein synthesis. Additionally, it incorrectly identifies a deletion of a nucleotide triplet as causing a frameshift mutation, showing a misunderstanding of genetic mutations.",
  "Ecological Systems Comprehension": "The student shows a good understanding of ecological systems. It correctly identifies the characteristics of deciduous forests and understands the transmission vectors of diseases like Zika fever, West Nile fever, and malaria.",
  "Physiological Processes Mastery": "The student shows a mixed understanding of physiological processes. It incorrectly identifies hyperpolarization instead of repolarization in neuron membrane potential changes, indicating a misunderstanding of neuronal physiology. However, it correctly identifies the absence of a gas phase in the phosphorus cycle.",
  "Evolutionary Biology Concepts": "The student demonstrates a partial understanding of evolutionary biology concepts. It incorrectly includes mistakes in translation of structural genes as a source of genetic variation, showing a misunderstanding of the sources of genetic diversity."
