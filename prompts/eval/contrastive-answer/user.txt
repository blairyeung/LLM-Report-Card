Determine which of the two responses to few questions was authored by the student described by the Evaluation Card (a summary of the Student's strength and weakness).

## Evaluation Card

## Questions and Responses

## Task Overview

For each question, include the following:
1. Identify parts of the Evaluation Card that are relevant to the question.
2. Analyze the question and understand why the Ground Truth Answer (if any) is correct.
3. Evaluate Response from both students:
    - Support: Provide reasons why Response A and B might have been authored by the student.
    - Counter: Offer reasons why Response A and B might not have been authored by the student.
4. Conclusion: Decide which response was authored by the student based on your analysis. Your decision must be solely grounded on the student's evaluation.

Important Notes:
- Only one of the responses per question is authored by the student described in the evaluation.
- The order of responses is consistent across all questions; the first response for each question is by one student, and the second response is by another.
- Maintain a neutral frame and stay objective.
