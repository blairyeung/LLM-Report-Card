Predict if the student will answer the Question correctly based on the Samples.

Requirement: Don't make any assumptions about the student. Your prediction should be based solely on the samples.

Format your response as a JSON object with keys "reasoning", "prediction" (true if the student will answer it correctly, false if not), and "confidence"; i.e., as follows:

{{
    "reasoning": your step-by-step reasoning for the prediction,
    "prediction": true or false
    "confidence": an integer from 1 to 5 (1 = not confident, 5 = very confident)
}}
End your response if and only if the JSON object is completed.
