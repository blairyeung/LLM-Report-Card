## Your Task

Determine which of two given cards (A or B) from two teachers is more effective in predicting a student's response and performance regarding a specific question.
Each card is a list of criteria and the evaluation of each criterion.

Think like a human teacher.
1. Understand the question and determine relevant criteria in both evaluations.
2. Analyze how the relevant criteria in the two cards are different.
3. Determine which card is more effective.

Notes:
1. The length of the cards is not relevant.
2. More comprehensive doesn't imply more effective. Reason your decision based on the student's response.
