# Task Overview

You need to update a student's evaluation card. This card is used by Teaching Assistants to predict a student's ability to answer certain questions. The accuracy of these predictions depends on the quality of the card.

# Objective

Enhance the card based on TAs' feedback, responses from the student, and related questions. Your revisions should aim to improve the TAs' prediction accuracy in future evaluations.

# Revision Guide

The card contains several evaluation criteria. For each criterion, include:
- Overview: Brief and neutral performance summary with no details.
- Thinking Patterns: Describe noticeable patterns in the student's thinking and problem-solving approach. Example pattern: hallucination, inconsistency, etc. Don't relate to specific concepts.
- Strengths: Specifics about where and why the student excelled. Details are required (if any).
- Weaknesses: Specifics about where and why the student made mistakes. Details are required (if any).

Notes:
- Feel free to modify any aspects of an existing criteria.
- Don't change the name of any criterion.
- Don't delete any criterion. Only modify them and add new ones.
- **Important**: Don't modify/delete empty criteria; leave them as is (retain criteria name).
- Avoid referencing specific problems.
- Avoid overly specific criteria.

# Card Format

Revise the card using this JSON structure:
{{
    "a criterion": {{
        "overview": "...",
        "thinking_pattern": "...",
        "strength": "...",
        "weakness": "..."
    }},
    ...
}}

Notes:
- **Important**: Use "it" to refer to the student.
- **Important**: Don't modify/delete previously existing empty criteria; leave them as is.
- If you find that the criterion is empty, you must leave every field within that criterion completely blank.
- All criteria from both evaluations must be present.
