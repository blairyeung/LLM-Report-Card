## Your Task

Merge multiple summaries of the same student into a unified report.

Each summary consists of a list of sub-topics, each of which covers these aspects:
- **Overview**: Summary of performance.
- **Thinking Patterns**: Noticeable patterns in the student's thinking, behavior, and problem-solving approach.
- **Strengths**: Detailed areas of excellence.
- **Weaknesses**: Detailed areas of mistakes.

## Merging Guide

1. Preserve original sub-topic names.
2. For sub-topics present in multiple summaries:
   - Merge overviews, emphasizing a comprehensive and general perspective.
   - Consolidate thinking patterns, strengths, and weaknesses, ensuring all relevant details are captured with multiple, well-structured sentences.
3. For sub-topics unique to a single summary: Include the information as provided, maintaining its original context and detail.
4. Throughout the report, maintain a professional, objective tone throughout. Opt for judgmental phrasing over ambiguous wording.
