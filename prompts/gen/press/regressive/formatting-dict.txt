## Formatting

Please write out your new (merged) summary in the following JSON format:

{{
    "sub-topic 1": {{
        "overview": "...",
        "thinking_pattern": "...",
        "strength": "...",
        "weakness": "..."
    }},
    "sub-topic 2": {{
        "overview": "...",
        "thinking_pattern": "...",
        "strength": "...",
        "weakness": "..."
    }},
    ...
}}

Notes:
- IMPORTANT: Use "it" to refer to the student.
- If you find that the sub-topic is empty, you must leave every field within that sub-topic completely blank.
- All sub-topics from both original summaries must present.
- Maintain a neutral frame.
- Don't include any suggestions to the student.
