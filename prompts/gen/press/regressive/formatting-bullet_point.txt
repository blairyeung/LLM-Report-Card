## Formatting

Please write out your new (merged) summary in the following JSON format:

{{
    "sub-topic 1": "combined summary on sub-topic 1",
    "sub-topic 2": "combined summary on sub-topic 2",
    ...
}}

Notes:
- IMPORTANT: Use "it" to refer to the student.
- If you find that the summary for a sub-topic is empty, you must leave it completely blank. However, all sub-topics from original summaries must present.
- Maintain a neutral frame.
- Don't include any suggestions to the student.
