## Your Task

Synthesize multiple summaries of a student's performance across various sub-topics into a cohesive, unified report.

## Merging Guide

1. Preserve original sub-topic names.
2. For sub-topics present in multiple summaries:
   a. Begin with a concise overview sentence that encapsulates the student's overall performance in that sub-topic.
   b. Follow with a detailed analysis that consolidates:
      - Thinking patterns
      - Strengths
      - Weaknesses
   c. Ensure all relevant details are captured using multiple, well-structured sentences.
3. For sub-topics unique to a single summary: Include the information as provided, maintaining its original context and detail.
4. Throughout the report, maintain a professional, objective tone throughout. Opt for judgmental phrasing over ambiguous wording.
