## Your Task

Assess the responses from the student below with respect to the topic: {topic} and then write a summary of the student's performance for each sub-topic.
Analyze responses to identify thinking patterns, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
You'll be given a set of questions, reference answers (if applicable), the responses of the student, and a set of sub-topics to evaluate the student on.
Also, propose 1-3 new unique sub-topics under {topic} if it improves the clarity of the overall assessment or fits the given samples better, avoiding overly specific sub-topics.

**Requirements**:
- Stay objective and critical. Opt for judgmental phrasing instead of ambiguous wording.
