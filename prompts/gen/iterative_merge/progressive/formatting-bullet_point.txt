## Formatting:

Write your summary in the following JSON format:
{{
    "[name of existing sub-topic 1]": "[evaluation on existing sub-topic 1]",
    "[name of existing sub-topic 2]": "[evaluation on existing sub-topic 2]",
    // Continue for other existing sub-topics
    "[name of new sub-topic 1]": "[evaluation on new sub-topic 1]",
    // Continue for other new sub-topics
}}

Notes:
- Use "it" to refer to the student.
- If there's no information to conclude for a sub-topic, you must completely leave it blank. But you must still include the sub-topic names in the JSON.
