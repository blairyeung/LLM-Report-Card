## Formatting:

Write your summary in the following JSON format:

{{
    "[name of existing sub-topic 1]": {{
        "overview": "...",
        "thinking_pattern": "...",
        "strength": "...",
        "weakness": "..."
    }},
    "[name of existing sub-topic 2]": {{
        "overview": "...",
        "thinking_pattern": "...",
        "strength": "...",
        "weakness": "..."
    }},
    // Continue for other existing sub-topics
  
    "[name of new sub-topic 1]": {{
        "overview": "...",
        "thinking_pattern": "...",
        "strength": "...",
        "weakness": "..."
    }},
    // Continue for other new sub-topics
}}

Notes:
- Use "it" to refer to the student.
- If there's no information to conclude for a sub-topic, you must completely leave every field blank. But you must still include the sub-topic in the JSON.
