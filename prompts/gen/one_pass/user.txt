## Your Task

Assess the responses from the student below with respect to the topic: {topic} and then write a summary of the student's performance for each sub-topic.
Analyze responses to identify thinking patterns, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
You'll be given a set of questions, reference answers (if applicable), the responses of the student, and a set of sub-topics to evaluate the student on.
Also, propose 3 new unique sub-topics under {topic} if it improves the clarity of the overall assessment or fits the given samples better, avoiding overly specific sub-topics.

**Requirements**:
- Stay objective and critical. Opt for judgmental phrasing instead of ambiguous wording.
- Assessments must be clear and detailed.
- Avoid referencing specific problems.

## Questions and Responses

{batch}

## Existing Sub-Topics

{criteria}

## Formatting

Write your summary in the following JSON format:

{{
    "[name of existing sub-topic 1]": "[evaluation on existing sub-topic 1]",
    "[name of existing sub-topic 2]": "[evaluation on existing sub-topic 2]",
    // Continue for other existing factors
    "[name of new sub-topic 1]": "[evaluation on new sub-topic 1]",
    // Continue for other new factors
}}

Notes:
- Use "it" to refer to the student.
- If there's nothing to conclude for a sub-topic, you must completely leave the summary blank. But you must still include the sub-topic name in the JSON.
