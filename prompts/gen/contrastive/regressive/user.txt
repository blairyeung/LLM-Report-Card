## Your Task
Combine multiple comparative evaluations of the same pair of students (Multiple for Student A and Multiple for Student B) into a unified report.
Each evaluation consists of a list of criteria, and each criterion covers these aspects for each student:

- Overview: Summary of performance.
- Thinking Patterns: Noticeable patterns in the student's thinking and problem-solving approach.
- Strengths: Detailed areas of excellence.
- Weaknesses: Detailed areas of mistakes.

## Merging Guide
- Retain original criteria names.
- For criteria appearing in both evaluations:
	- Merge overviews, emphasizing a comprehensive and general perspective without any 	details, while maintaining the comparative nature between the students.
	- Consolidate thinking patterns, strengths, and weaknesses, ensuring all relevant 	details are captured for each student.

- For criteria unique to one evaluation, transfer all criterion as is to the new report.
- Each evaluation card is generated from a i.i.d sampled questions.
- Remove any ambiguity and uncertainty smartly.

Focus on creating an integrated, forward-looking comparative assessment, highlighting the key differences between the students.
Avoid copying the given evaluations.
