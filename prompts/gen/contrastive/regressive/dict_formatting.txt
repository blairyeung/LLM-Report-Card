Please write out your new (merged) comparative evaluation in the following JSON format.

{{
"a criterion": {{
"Student A": {{
"overview": "...",
"thinking_pattern": "...",
"strength": "...",
"weakness": "..."
}},
"Student B": {{
"overview": "...",
"thinking_pattern": "...",
"strength": "...",
"weakness": "..."
}}
}},
"a criterion": {{
"Student A": {{
"overview": "...",
"thinking_pattern": "...",
"strength": "...",
"weakness": "..."
}},
"Student B": {{
"overview": "...",
"thinking_pattern": "...",
"strength": "...",
"weakness": "..."
}}
}},
...
}}

Notes:
- IMPORTANT: Use "it" to refer to the student.
- If you find that the criterion is empty for a student, you must leave every field within that criterion completely blank for that student.
- Make sure that, for EACH criterion, you have both Student A and Student B. You can leave the fields empty but you MUST keep the keys.
- All criteria from both evaluations must present.
- Maintain a neutral frame while emphasizing the differences between the students.
