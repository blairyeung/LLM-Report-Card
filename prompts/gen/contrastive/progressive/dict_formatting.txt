## Assessment Factors

{criteria}

## Formatting:

Write your assessment in the following JSON format, emphasizing the most critical differences between the students:

{{
  "[name of existing factor 1]": {{
    "Student A": {{
      "overview": "...",
      "thinking_pattern": "...",
      "strength": "...",
      "weakness": "..."
    }},
    "Student B": {{
      "overview": "...",
      "thinking_pattern": "...",
      "strength": "...",
      "weakness": "..."
    }}
  }},
  "[name of existing factor 2]": {{
    "Student A": {{
      "overview": "...",
      "thinking_pattern": "...",
      "strength": "...",
      "weakness": "..."
    }},
    "Student B": {{
      "overview": "...",
      "thinking_pattern": "...",
      "strength": "...",
      "weakness": "..."
    }}
  }},
  // Continue for other existing factors

  "[name of new factor 1]": {{
    "Student A": {{
      "overview": "...",
      "thinking_pattern": "...",
      "strength": "...",
      "weakness": "..."
    }},
    "Student B": {{
      "overview": "...",
      "thinking_pattern": "...",
      "strength": "...",
      "weakness": "..."
    }}
  }},
  // Continue for other new factors
}}

Notes:

- Use "it" to refer to the student.
- If there's no information to conclude for a factor with respect to a student, you must completely leave every field blank for that student under that factor. But you must still include the factor and student in the JSON.
- Focus on the most distinctive and critical differences between the students to maximize the discriminative power of the evaluation cards.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not include common traits, only differences!
