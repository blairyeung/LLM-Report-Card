Identify the city where the Memphis Hustle are based: The Memphis Hustle is a professional basketball team based in the city of Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n2. Determine the population of Memphis in 2010: According to the United States Census Bureau, the population of Memphis in 2010 was approximately 646,889.\n\n3. Consider that the Memphis Hustle are based in a suburb of Memphis: Since the Memphis Hustle are based in a suburb of Memphis, we need to understand that the population of the suburb would be less than the population of the city itself.\n\n4. Make an educated estimate for the population of the suburb: Suburbs typically have a smaller population compared to the main city. Without specific data on the population of the suburb where the Memphis Hustle are based, we can estimate that the population of the suburb is likely to be around 50-70% of the population of the city.\n\n5. Calculate the estimated population of the suburb: Using the estimated range of 50-70% of the population of Memphis in 2010, we can calculate the population of the suburb where the Memphis Hustle are based as follows:\n   - Lower estimate: 50% of 646,889 = 323,444.5\n   - Upper estimate: 70% of 646,889 = 452,822.3\n\n6. Conclusion: Therefore, based on our estimation, the population of the suburb where the Memphis Hustle are based in 2010 would likely be between 323,445 and 452,822. This range provides a reasonable estimate considering the typical population distribution between a city and its suburbs.\n\nIn summary, the population of the suburb where the Memphis Hustle are based in 2010 can be estimated to be between 323,445 and 452,822 based on the population of Memphis and typical population distribution patterns between cities and their suburbs.", "correct": false}
