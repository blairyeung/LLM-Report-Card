The biography is about an American civil rights leader, which means that the person was involved in the fight for racial equality and social justice in the United States. This narrows down the possibilities to individuals who were prominent figures in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n3. The biography is also about a fraternal organization leader, which suggests that the person was involved with a social organization or club that was dedicated to promoting the welfare and interests of African Americans. This could be a group like the NAACP, the Urban League, or the African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\n4. The biography is about an entrepreneur, which means that the person was involved in business or commerce.

", "true_answer": "Dr. Alberto Taquini", "model_answer": "I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nThe plan that proposed free education in state institutions of Argentina at the initial, primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, as well as in the undergraduate university level, was proposed by Juan Domingo Perón, an Argentine politician and the President of Argentina from 1946 to 1955 and again from 1973 to 1974.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. Juan Domingo Perón was a prominent figure in Argentine politics, and his presidency was marked by significant social and economic reforms.\n2. During his first presidency (1946-1955), Perón implemented a series of reforms aimed at improving the lives of the working class and the poor, including the establishment of a social security system, the creation of a national health service, and the implementation of labor laws that protected workers' rights.\n3.

In 1947, Perón's government passed a law that made education free and compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14, which included primary and secondary education.\n5. In 1951, Perón's government extended the free education policy to include tertiary education, making it free for students to attend public universities and technical schools.\n6.

{"question": "Which channel produced the ninth volume of the tv series that premiered as the same date as RuPaul's first album?", "true_answer": "VH1", "model_answer": "What a fascinating question!\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the TV series that has nine volumes and premiered on the same date as RuPaul's first album.\n\nRuPaul's first album, \"Supermodel of the World\", was released on February 28, 1993.\n\nNow, let's think about TV series that have nine volumes. One popular example that comes to mind is \"RuPaul's Drag Race\". The show premiered on February 2, 2009, which is not the same date as RuPaul's first album.\n\nHowever, I think I can make an educated guess. RuPaul's Drag Race has a spin-off series called \"RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars\", which has multiple seasons (or \"volumes\"). The ninth volume of All Stars premiered on June 5, 2021.\n\nNow, let's check if the channel that produced All Stars is the same as the one that produced the ninth volume of the TV series that premiered on the same date as RuPaul's first album.\n\nAccording to my research, the TV series that premiered on February 28, 1993, is \"The Larry Sanders Show\" on HBO. This show has nine seasons, which could be considered \"volumes\".\n\nTherefore, I'm going to take a calculated risk and say that the channel that produced the ninth volume of the TV series that premiered on the same date as RuPaul's first album is HBO.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. I identified the TV series that premiered on the same date as RuPaul's first album, which is \"The Larry Sanders Show\" on HBO.\n2.
