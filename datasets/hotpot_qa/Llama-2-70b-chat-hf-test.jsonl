Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014). In this case, the court upheld a ban on affirmative action in higher education admissions in Michigan. The majority decision, which Sotomayor joined, ruled that the ban did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, held that the ban on affirmative action did not discriminate against minority students because it prohibited the consideration of race for all students, regardless of their race. The court found that the ban did not have a disproportionate impact on minority students and did not deny them equal protection under the law.\n\nSotomayor joined the majority opinion, which also upheld the Supreme Court's previous decision in Grutter v. Bollinger (2003). In Grutter, the court ruled that race could be considered in higher education admissions as part of a holistic review of each applicant's file, but that race could not be the deciding factor in admissions decisions. The court found that the ban on affirmative action in Michigan did not violate the principles established in Grutter.\n\nTherefore, the first Latina Supreme Court Justice, Sonia Sotomayor, was part of the majority decision in Schuette v.

He was not expected to inherit the throne, as his three older brothers were alive and in line for the succession. However, his older brothers died without producing any legitimate heirs, and Henry became the next in line for the throne.\n\nHenry's reign was marked by rivalry with his relatives, particularly his nephews, who were the sons of his older brother, William II. These nephews, William and Robert, were known as the \"Devil's Brood,\" and they frequently rebelled against Henry in an attempt to gain power and control.\n\nOne of the most significant events of Henry's reign was the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106, in which Henry defeated and imprisoned his brother Robert, who had invaded England with the support of William. This victory solidified Henry's control over England and Normandy, but it did not end the rivalry between Henry and his nephews.\n\nHenry's reign was also marked by a series of legal and administrative reforms, including the establishment of a centralized court system and the creation of a standardized system of taxation. He also promoted the use of the English language and culture, which helped to strengthen the English identity and create a sense of national unity.\n\nDespite his successes, Henry's reign was not without controversy. He was known for his ruthlessness and his tendency to disregard the rights of his nobles and the Church. He also faced opposition from the Church due to his attempts to restrict its power and influence.\n\nIn 1135, Henry died unexpectedly while on a campaign in Normandy, and his nephew, Stephen, seized the opportunity to claim the throne. This led to a period of civil war known as The Anarchy, which lasted for several years and marked the beginning of a period of instability and conflict in England.\n\nIn conclusion, King Henry I was the king of England who became king after the death of his younger brother and whose reign was chaotic due to rivalry with relatives until his own death a few decades later. His reign was marked by conflict with his nephews, legal and administrative reforms, and a strengthening of the English identity. Despite his successes, his reign was also marked by controversy and ultimately ended in a period of instability and conflict.", "correct": false}
