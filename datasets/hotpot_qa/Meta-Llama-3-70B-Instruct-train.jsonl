While it does blend elements from fantasy, adventure, and mythology, it might not meet the \"numerous locations\" criterion.\n* The Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher: This urban fantasy series is set in modern-day Chicago and features a wizard detective as the protagonist. While it does incorporate elements from multiple genres (fantasy, mystery, horror), the locations are primarily limited to Chicago and its surroundings.\n* The Discworld series by Terry Pratchett: This series is set in a fictional world, with a flat disc balanced on the backs of four elephants, which are in turn standing on the back of a giant turtle.
