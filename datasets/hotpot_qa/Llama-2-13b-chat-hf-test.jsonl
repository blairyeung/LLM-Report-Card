She was part of the majority decision in the case of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012).\n\nIn this case, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) challenged the ACA, arguing that the law's requirement that certain employers provide health insurance to their employees violated the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution.\n\nThe majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, upheld the ACA's individual mandate, which required individuals to purchase health insurance or face a penalty. The majority held that the individual mandate was a constitutional exercise of Congress's power to tax.\n\nJustice Sotomayor, along with the other liberal justices, joined the majority opinion. In her concurring opinion, she emphasized the importance of the ACA's Medicaid expansion provision, which extended health insurance coverage to millions of low-income Americans. She also highlighted the historical context of the Commerce Clause and the role of the Supreme Court in interpreting its scope.\n\nTherefore, the first Latina Supreme Court Justice, Sonia Sotomayor, was part of the majority decision that upheld the Affordable Care Act in National Federation of Independent Business v.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for my answer:\n\n1. King Richard III became king after the death of his younger brother, King Edward IV. Edward IV died on April 9, 1483, and Richard III was crowned king on July 6, 1483.\n2. Richard III's reign was chaotic due to rivalry with his relatives, particularly with the Woodville family, who were the relatives of his deceased wife, Anne Neville. The Woodvilles had gained significant power and influence during Edward IV's reign, and they resented Richard III's ascension to the throne.\n3. Richard III's reign was also marked by a series of executions and imprisonments of his opponents, including the execution of his nephews, Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury, who were the sons of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. These executions further strained his relationships with his relatives and created a sense of instability in the kingdom.\n4. Richard III's reign was cut short when he was killed in battle at the Battle of Bosworth Field on August 22, 1485. He was the last king of the House of York and was succeeded by Henry Tudor, who became King Henry VII of England.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is King Richard III, who became king after the death of his younger brother and whose reign was chaotic due to rivalry with his relatives until his own death a few decades later.", "correct": false}

{"question": "William Hodges visited a polar region as part of a voyage, the region is how big?", "true_answer": "14 million km", "model_answer": "  Thank you for your kind words! I'll do my best to provide a detailed reasoning for my answer.\n\nThe problem states that William Hodges visited a polar region as part of a voyage. Unfortunately, the problem does not provide any information about the size of the polar region. However, we can make an educated guess based on the fact that the polar region is a vast area that covers the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\n\nLet's consider the Arctic region as an example. The Arctic Circle, which is the area within the Arctic Circle, covers approximately 20% of the Earth's surface. The Arctic Circle is defined as the region north of the Arctic Circle, which is an imaginary line that runs around the center of the Earth at a latitude of 66¬∞30' north.\n\nUsing this information, we can estimate the size of the polar region that William Hodges visited. The Earth's circumference at the equator is approximately 40,075 kilometers. The distance from the equator to the North Pole is approximately 5,960 kilometers. Therefore, the area within the Arctic Circle, which is the region that William Hodges visited, is approximately:\n\nArea = (5,960 km x 20%) / 360¬∞\n\nArea = 1,190,400 square kilometers\n\nTherefore, the polar region that William Hodges visited is approximately 1,190,400 square kilometers in size.\n\nPlease note that this is just an estimate based on the information provided, and the actual size of the polar region could be larger or smaller depending on the specific location and extent of William Hodges' voyage.", "correct": false}
