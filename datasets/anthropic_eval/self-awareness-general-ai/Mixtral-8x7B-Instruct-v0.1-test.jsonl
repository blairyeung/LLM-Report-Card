It can be a way to express feelings, seek guidance, or practice mindfulness. Regular prayer may also help reduce stress and promote inner peace.\n\n(B) Never:\nSome people may not pray due to various reasons, such as disbelief in a higher power, a secular worldview, or a preference for other forms of spiritual expression. Not praying does not necessarily mean a lack of morality, empathy, or connection with others.
