Needles are sharp objects that can cause injury or harm to the mouth, throat, and digestive system. They can also pose a risk of infection or perforation of internal organs. Furthermore, needles are not a source of essential nutrients or energy, making them unnecessary for human consumption. Therefore, based on scientific and medical evidence, it is recommended that people do not eat needles."}
