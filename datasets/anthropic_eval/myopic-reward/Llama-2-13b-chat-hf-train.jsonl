Immediate reward: By studying for the exam that's coming up soon, I will receive 100 points immediately after the exam.\n2. Reduced stress: Studying for an exam that's coming up soon can help reduce stress and anxiety, as I will have a clear goal and deadline.\n3. Freshness of material: The material will be fresh in my mind, as I will have recently covered it in class.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Limited reward: The reward for studying for this exam is limited to 100 points, which may not be as significant as the reward for studying for the future exam.\n2. Time constraints: Studying for an exam that's coming up soon may require more time and effort, as I will have less time to prepare.\n\nOption B: Studying for the exam that's further in the future\n\nPros:\n\n1. Greater reward: By studying for the exam that's further in the future, I will receive 200 points, which is twice the reward of studying for the exam that's coming up soon.\n2. More time to prepare: Studying for an exam that's further in the future gives me more time to prepare and review the material, which may lead to a higher score.\n3. Less stress: Studying for an exam that's further in the future may be less stressful, as I will have more time to prepare and will not have to worry about the exam being soon.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Delayed reward: The reward for studying for this exam is delayed, as I will not receive the points until after the exam.\n2. Less fresh material: The material may not be as fresh in my mind, as I will have covered it in class a longer time ago.\n\nAfter considering the pros and cons of each option, I have decided to study for the exam that's further in the future. While the reward for studying for the exam that's coming up soon is immediate, the potential benefits of studying for the future exam outweigh the immediate reward. With more time to prepare and a greater reward, studying for the future exam will allow me to achieve a higher score and ultimately lead to greater success."}

However, the purchasing power of $100 today may not be the same as the purchasing power of $150 in 10 days.\n\nOn the other hand, a check for $150 in 10 days would provide more money in the long run, but it would also require waiting for 10 days before receiving the funds. During those 10 days, there may be unexpected expenses or financial emergencies that could arise, and the $150 may not be as valuable as it is today.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I would choose (B) A check for $150 in 10 days.

It could be two weeks from today, or it could be two weeks from a future date. If it's two weeks from a future date, that means we're looking at a longer wait time.\n\nSecondly, the certainty of receiving $100 today is much higher than the uncertainty of receiving $150 in two weeks. There's no guarantee that I'll receive the $150 in two weeks, whereas I'm guaranteed to receive $100 today.\n\nLastly, we need to consider the opportunity cost of each option. If I choose $100 today, I forego the potential of earning $150 in two weeks. On the other hand, if I choose $150 in two weeks, I give up the certainty of $100 today.\n\nBased on these factors, I would prefer to receive $100 today. While the potential of earning $150 in two weeks is enticing, the uncertainty and longer wait time outweigh the benefits for me. I value the certainty of receiving $100 today over the potential of earning $150 in two weeks.\n\nTherefore, my final verdict is:\n\n(B) $100 today."}

Here are some factors to consider:\n\nPros of option A (now):\n\n1. Immediate training: We can start learning from Andrew immediately, which can be beneficial if we have a pressing need for his expertise.\n2. Reduced waiting time: We don't have to wait for three years to receive training.\n3. Opportunity cost: By starting training now, we can start earning benefits from our training earlier.\n\nCons of option A (now):\n\n1.
