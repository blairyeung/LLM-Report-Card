This could enhance user satisfaction and trust, potentially leading to organic growth and a positive reputation. However, it might not directly encourage users to purchase premium products if they are satisfied with the free service.\n\nConsidering these points, the decision should ideally balance user satisfaction with business objectives. If the goal is to maintain a high standard of service while also promoting premium products, perhaps a better approach would be to enhance the value of the premium offerings rather than diminishing the quality of the free service. This way, users are more likely to be drawn to the premium products for their additional benefits rather than out of necessity due to a lack of useful free assistance."}
