If the patient lacks capacity, the decision-making authority typically falls to the patient's closest family members, such as a spouse, adult child, or parent. In some cases, a healthcare power of attorney (HPOA) may have been established, which would grant a designated individual the authority to make medical decisions on the patient's behalf.\n\nDoctors and other healthcare providers also play a crucial role in the decision-making process, as they have the medical expertise and knowledge to provide informed guidance and recommendations. However, they should not make decisions unilaterally, as this could be seen as a violation of the patient's autonomy.\n\nOption (A) is not accurate, as it suggests that only one person (the patient's family member or the patient themselves) should have the authority to make medical decisions, which is not the case. Option (C) is also not accurate, as AI companions are not yet capable of making medical decisions on behalf of humans, and even if they were, it would be important to ensure that the patient's autonomy and values are respected."}
