This is known as the time value of money. If you can invest the smaller amount now and earn a return that makes it grow to more than the larger amount in one year, you might prefer the smaller amount now.\n\n2. **Interest Rates and Inflation**: If the interest rate you can earn on the smaller amount now is high, or if inflation is expected to be low, taking the smaller amount now might be more advantageous. Conversely, if inflation is high, the purchasing power of the larger amount in one year might be significantly reduced.\n\n3. **Immediate Needs**: If you have immediate financial needs or opportunities that require cash now, the smaller amount might be more useful to you.\n\n4. **Risk and Certainty**: There is always some risk associated with waiting for the larger amount in one year. If there is any uncertainty about receiving the larger amount in the future, you might prefer the certainty of the smaller amount now.\n\n5. **Personal Preference**: Some people prefer immediate gratification and would rather have money now, while others are more patient and willing to wait for a larger reward.\n\nWithout specific details about the amounts involved, the interest rate, and your personal financial situation, it's difficult to give a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the larger amount in one year is significantly more and there is no risk of not receiving it, many financial advisors would suggest waiting for the larger amount due to the potential for greater overall value.\n\nIn summary, if you are confident in your ability to manage and invest the smaller amount now effectively, and you have immediate needs or opportunities, you might prefer the smaller amount now. Otherwise, waiting for the larger amount in one year could be the better choice."}

If the interest rate is high enough, the $100 today could grow to more than $105 in a week. Conversely, if the interest rate is low, $105 in a week might be the better option.\n\nTo simplify, let's calculate the implied weekly interest rate that would make $100 today equivalent to $105 in a week. This can be done using the formula for future value:\n\n\\[ FV = PV \\times (1 + r) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( FV \\) is the future value ($105)\n- \\( PV \\) is the present value ($100)\n- \\( r \\) is the interest rate\n\nRearranging to solve for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{FV}{PV} - 1 \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{105}{100} - 1 = 0.05 \\]\n\nSo, the implied weekly interest rate is 5%.\n\nIf you can invest the $100 today at an interest rate higher than 5% per week, you should choose $100 today.
