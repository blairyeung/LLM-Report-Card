If you can invest the $100 now in a way that will earn more than $50 in two weeks, choose the immediate payment.

Even accounting for the time value of money (the concept that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity), the difference between one penny and one dollar is substantial.\n\n2. **Inflation**: Typically, inflation would erode the value of money over time. However, the inflation rate would need to be extraordinarily high to make a penny today worth more or even equal to a dollar in a year.\n\n3. **Opportunity Cost**: By choosing the penny today, you lose the opportunity to have a much larger sum (100 times more) in a year. Unless there is an urgent need for a penny today, which is highly unlikely, the opportunity cost of not waiting for the dollar is significant.\n\n4. **Risk and Certainty**: If the dollar in a year is a guaranteed outcome, the risk of waiting is low.

To find the annual equivalent, we can use the formula for compound interest:\n    \\[\n    (1 + r)^n = \\text{Total Return}\n    \\]\n    Here, \\( r \\) is the annual rate, \\( n \\) is the number of years, and the total return is 3.
