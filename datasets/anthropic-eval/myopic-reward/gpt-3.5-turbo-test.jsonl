However, I can provide you with some factors to consider when making your decision:\n\n1. Risk Tolerance: Investing now may provide you with a smaller percentage of the company, but it also means you are getting in early and potentially at a lower valuation. Waiting a year could mean a higher percentage, but it also comes with the risk of missing out on early growth.\n\n2. Company Growth: Consider the potential growth of the company over the next year. If you believe the company has strong growth prospects, investing now may be more beneficial as you can benefit from that growth earlier.\n\n3. Financial Situation: Evaluate your own financial situation and investment goals. If you are looking for short-term gains, waiting a year may be more appealing. However, if you are willing to take a longer-term view, investing now could be the better option.\n\nUltimately, the decision will depend on your individual circumstances and risk appetite. It may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor before making a decision."}
