British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nThe city of Ghana consists of two towns.

The text mentions the invasion of Christian lands by the Persians, the dismemberment of the Greek kingdom, and the need to avenge these wrongs and recover territory. These events are directly related to the Crusades and are not associated with the Mongol invasions, the Protestant Reformation, or the Age of Discovery."}, "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": {"answer": 3, "reasoning": "The speech is about calling upon Christians to liberate Jerusalem from the hands of non-Christians. This concept aligns best with the context of the Crusades, which was a series of religious wars between Christians and Muslims over the Holy Land. The Mongol invasions, the Protestant Reformation, and the Age of Discovery do not involve religious wars over the Holy Land."}, "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": {"answer": 3, "reasoning": "The speech given by Pope Urban II in 1095 CE, as recorded by Robert the Monk, is best understood in the context of the Crusades. The speech is addressed to the knights and soldiers of Europe, urging them to take up arms and liberate the Holy Land from the 'accursed race' of the Persians, who have invaded and depopulated Christian lands. The speech emphasizes the glory and greatness of the Christian kings who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans and extended the territory of the holy church. It also invokes the holy sepulchre of the Lord and the holy places that are currently treated with ignominy and polluted by the heathens. Therefore, the correct answer is D. The Crusades."}, "Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": {"answer": 3, "reasoning": "The speech by Pope Urban II is a call to arms for the Christians to reclaim the Holy Land from the Muslims, who have taken control of Jerusalem and other Christian lands. The speech emphasizes the importance of Jerusalem as a sacred city and the responsibility of the Christians to liberate it from non-believers. The speech also mentions the successes of past rulers, such as Charles the Great and Louis, in expanding the territory of the holy church. The context of the speech is therefore the Crusades, a series of military campaigns by Christian Europe to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim rule. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) The Crusades."}}}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.\nFirstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…\n…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.\"\nMartin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520\nWhen the author of the passage above discusses the \"second wall,\" to what is he referring?", "choices": ["The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate definition of \"Holy Ghost\"", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate theological belief about the divinity of Jesus", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate method of baptism"], "answer": 1, "models": {"Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": {"answer": 1, "reasoning": "The author is discussing the ways in which the Roman Catholic practices have protected the Romanists from reform.
