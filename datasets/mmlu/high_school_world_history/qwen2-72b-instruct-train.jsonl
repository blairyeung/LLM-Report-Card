The Industrial Revolution.\n\nReasoning:\nThe passage describes a trade pattern where the Portuguese would exchange goods like silk, gold, and porcelain for silver from Japan, and then use that silver to buy more goods in China. This was part of the larger trade network that existed between Asia and Europe during the early modern period. The goods traded were often luxury items that required skilled labor and craftsmanship, which were produced in limited quantities.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century and continued into the 19th century, fundamentally changed the nature of production in Europe. It led to the mechanization of manufacturing processes, increasing the efficiency and scale of production. This allowed European countries to produce goods in greater quantities and often at lower costs than could be achieved through traditional methods.\n\nAs a result, European goods became more competitive on the global market, and the demand for Asian goods, such as silk and porcelain, decreased relative to the supply of European manufactured goods. This shift in the balance of trade meant that the traditional trade patterns described in the passage were disrupted. European countries no longer needed to acquire large amounts of silver to purchase Asian goods because they could now offer their own manufactured goods in exchange.\n\nTherefore, the Industrial Revolution is the development that most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the passage by altering the comparative advantages of European and Asian economies."}

The text emphasizes the domestic responsibilities and the moral conduct expected of women, particularly within the context of serving their husbands and maintaining the household. It also highlights the importance of women's roles in perpetuating ancestral worship, which was a significant aspect of Chinese culture.\n\nConsidering the question about how women's lives were more restricted in the period 600 BCE to 600 CE compared to before the advent of sedentary societies, we need to analyze the options provided:\n\nA. Women were increasingly thought of as primary earners for the family.\n- This statement is not supported by historical evidence from the period. In fact, the passage suggests that women's roles were primarily domestic, focusing on managing the household rather than earning income.\n\nB. Women were increasingly responsible for the care of their children.\n- While this might be true to some extent, it does not address the question of increased restrictions. The care of children has always been a significant responsibility for women, both before and after the advent of sedentary societies.\n\nC. Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere.\n- This option aligns with the information provided in the passage and broader historical trends. As societies became more sedentary and hierarchical, women's roles often became more confined to the domestic realm. The passage reinforces this by outlining detailed expectations for women's behavior within the home and their roles in supporting their husbands and maintaining household duties.\n\nD. Women's power increasingly fell within the public sphere.\n- This statement contradicts the historical context. Women's public roles and influence often diminished as societies became more structured and patriarchal, especially during the period in question.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer based on the information provided and historical understanding is:\n\nC. Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere."}

Hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment. Both the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 in Australia and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 in the United States demonstrate policies designed to restrict or prohibit immigration based on nationality or perceived economic impact. These laws reflect a broader trend in the late 19th and early 20th centuries where many countries began to enact more stringent immigration controls, often targeting specific ethnic groups or laborers.\n\nThe Australian act, for instance, includes provisions that effectively discriminated against non-European immigrants through the use of a dictation test in a European language, which was arbitrarily chosen by the officer. This was a clear attempt to limit non-white immigration. Similarly, the U.S. act specifically targeted Chinese laborers, reflecting fears about the impact of Chinese workers on American jobs and wages, as well as racial prejudices.\n\nThese laws do not primarily address trade protectionism (option B), although there can be economic motivations behind them. They also do not reflect a growing desire to attract skilled labor from abroad (option C), as they both include provisions that would restrict immigration, even if there were exceptions for certain skilled workers. Anti-Semitism (option A) is not directly addressed in these acts, although xenophobia and racism were common themes in anti-immigrant sentiment during this period. However, the specific focus of these laws is on immigration restriction rather than exclusively anti-Semitic ideologies. Therefore, the most accurate characterization of the trend exemplified by these acts is the hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": ["Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown", "Killing of civilians during wartime", "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction", "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "The passages above can best be connected with form B: Killing of civilians during wartime.\n\nWilliam Howard Russell's account describes the violence perpetrated by Indian rebels against British civilians during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, specifically mentioning the killing of \"white men, women, or children.\" This context clearly fits within the framework of wartime violence where non-combatants are targeted.\n\nRudrangshu Mukherjee's analysis frames the violence as a response to the British colonial monopoly on violence, where the colonized people used violence to challenge the colonial hierarchy. He emphasizes that the violence was directed at British bodies that had been accorded special status and dignity under colonial rule. This further supports the connection to form B, as the violence described is not random banditry (A), collateral damage from weapons (C), or a state-sponsored campaign of genocide (D), but rather the intentional targeting of civilians during a period of armed conflict.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Killing of civilians during wartime."}

They kept horses in their court, which would have come from the Mongols.\n- While horses could be associated with Asian regions, particularly Central Asia, the passage does not specify the origin of the horses. Horses can also be native to Africa and Europe.\n\nB. The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow.\n- The passage does not mention any practice resembling the kow-tow, which is a traditional Chinese gesture of deep respect. Instead, it describes a local custom of kneeling and sprinkling dust on one's head for those who share the king's religion, and Muslims clapping their hands.\n\nC. The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.\n- While gold and jewels might suggest trade with regions known for these commodities, such as India, the passage does not provide specific evidence that these items came from Asia. Gold is mentioned to be abundant in Ghana itself, so it could be locally sourced.\n\nD. The people in his court wore silk robes.\n- This is the most plausible evidence of trade with Asia, as silk is a product historically associated with East Asia, particularly China. The fact that silk robes were worn by the people in the court suggests that there was a supply of silk reaching Ghana, likely through trade routes that connected West Africa with Asia.\n\nBased on the analysis, the strongest evidence of trade between Ghanians and Asia presented in the passage is **D. The people in his court wore silk robes**."}

In the context provided, Colonel Bonesteel's decision to use the 38th parallel as a dividing line for the surrender of Japanese forces in Korea was an early application of this strategy. By establishing a line that would limit Soviet influence to the northern part of the peninsula, Bonesteel was attempting to contain the spread of Soviet power and influence in the region.

The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment?", "choices": ["The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations", "The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market", "The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company", "The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "The statement by Walter Rodney attributes African underdevelopment primarily to the actions of Western European capitalists through the imperialist system. To best support this assertion, we need an option that directly involves Western European capitalists in actions that drained African wealth or hindered its development.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations: This directly implicates Western European capitalists, particularly British, French, Spanish, and Portuguese traders, in the transatlantic slave trade, which forcibly removed millions of Africans, disrupting local economies and societies. This action aligns with Rodney's claim about the exploitation of Africa by Western Europeans.\n\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market: While the Arab slave trade was significant, it does not specifically involve Western European capitalists as described by Rodney, thus it does not directly support his argument regarding Western European responsibility.\n\nC. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company: Although the Dutch were part of Western Europe, the primary purpose of the Cape Colony was initially as a refreshment station for Dutch ships traveling to the East Indies. While it later developed into a colony with its own economy, it does not directly demonstrate the exploitation or underdevelopment of Africa as vividly as the slave trade.\n\nD. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia: Trade links between Europe and Ethiopia could have been beneficial to both parties if they were equitable. Without evidence that these trade links were exploitative or detrimental to Ethiopia's development, this option does not directly support Rodney's argument.\n\nGiven these options, **A. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations** is the choice that best supports the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment. This is because it directly involves Western Europeans in an exploitative practice that significantly contributed to the underdevelopment of Africa by depleting its human resources."}

The passage describes how King Hormizd and later King Bahram conferred titles, honors, and authority upon Kerdir, who was a high priest in the Zoroastrian faith. This support from the kings allowed Kerdir to establish and promote the Zoroastrian religion across the empire, which in turn bolstered the legitimacy of the kings' rule.\n\nThe text does not mention any limitations imposed on the rulers by religious figures; instead, it portrays a mutually beneficial relationship where the kings use their power to support the Zoroastrian faith, and in return, the success of the religion legitimizes their rule.

No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road.

And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance). This statement is partially true, but not directly due to the Mongol conquest. The Mongol conquest did isolate Russia from some Western European developments, but it was more complex than this statement suggests. The Mongol Yoke, as it is known, did limit Russian interactions with Western Europe during the period of Mongol rule, but it wasn't the sole factor in Russia's later divergence from Western Europe.\n\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity. This statement is not accurate. While some cities in Russia, like Vladimir, did have interactions with the Mongols, Russia as a whole was not the administrative center of Mongol political activity. The Golden Horde, the Mongol khanate that ruled over Russia, had its capital at Sarai, which is in modern-day Russia but not central to what we would consider traditional Russian territories.\n\nC. Islam became the dominant religion of Russia. This statement is incorrect. Although the Golden Horde was predominantly Muslim, Islam did not become the dominant religion in Russia. Orthodox Christianity remained the dominant faith among the Slavic population throughout the Mongol period and beyond.\n\nD. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy. This statement is the most accurate based on historical understanding. The Mongol conquest influenced the development of a centralized state in Russia. The Mongol administrative practices, such as tax collection and a system of laws, contributed to the development of a centralized bureaucracy in Russia under the rule of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which later evolved into the Tsardom of Russia. This centralized administration helped Russia consolidate its power and expand its territories.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBut the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.

To determine which other classical empires could have similarly fallen due to such factors, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. **Tang and Ottoman Empires**\n   - The Tang Dynasty (618–907) in China experienced significant prosperity but also faced internal strife and external threats, leading to its eventual decline. However, it was more a result of political fragmentation and peasant revolts than the direct invasion of barbarian forces as described by Gibbon.\n   - The Ottoman Empire (1299–1922) is not considered a classical empire and is outside the scope of the question's context. However, it did experience similar issues regarding military corruption and external pressures that contributed to its decline.\n\nB. **Ming and Aztec Empires**\n   - The Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) in China faced issues like internal corruption and external invasions, particularly by the Manchu people, which eventually led to the establishment of the Qing Dynasty. This scenario aligns somewhat with Gibbon's analysis.\n   - The Aztec Empire (1325–1521) was brought down by the Spanish conquest, facilitated partly by internal weaknesses and the use of local allies against them, but this does not perfectly fit Gibbon's description since the Aztecs were not an expansive empire in the same sense as Rome.\n\nC. **Han and Gupta Empires**\n   - The Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) in China, one of the longest-lasting and most prosperous dynasties, saw its decline and fall due to factors such as internal decay, military corruption, and external pressures from nomadic tribes. These reasons are very much in line with those mentioned by Gibbon.\n   - The Gupta Empire (c. 320 – c. 550 AD) in India was characterized by cultural and scientific advancements but also faced internal rebellions and external invasions, leading to its gradual disintegration. The empire's weakening military and internal divisions make it a fitting candidate for comparison with Gibbon's analysis.\n\nD. **Qin and Etruscan Empires**\n   - The Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC), while short-lived, did unify China under a centralized government but collapsed due to internal unrest and harsh governance. Its fall does not directly correlate with Gibbon’s reasons for Rome's decline.\n   - The Etruscan civilization (c. 9th century – 2nd century BC) was influential in Italy before the rise of Rome but does not fit the criteria of a classical empire that fell due to overextension and internal decay in the manner described by Gibbon.\n\nConsidering the factors outlined by Gibbon, the most fitting answer is **C. Han and Gupta Empires**, as both these empires experienced internal decay, military corruption, and external pressures that led to their eventual decline and fall, mirroring the reasons given for the fall of the Roman Empire."}

The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems - This option suggests that the development of a literate class played a significant role in the creation of epic poetry. This is plausible because without a literate class, it would be much more difficult to preserve long narratives like epics. However, this alone does not explain the content or subject matter of the epics.\n\nB. The rise of a merchant class in cities who could sponsor the creation of original art - While merchants could potentially sponsor art, there is no direct evidence suggesting that the merchant class specifically sponsored the creation of epic poetry. Moreover, the focus of epic poetry tends to be on heroic deeds and kings rather than trade or commerce.\n\nC. The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings - This option implies that religious figures were primarily responsible for recording the deeds of divine or semi-divine rulers. While religion certainly played a role in the epic tradition (as seen in the divine attributes given to Gilgamesh), this answer does not fully encompass the broader societal context in which epics arose.\n\nD. The rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording - This option aligns well with the content of epic poetry, which often focuses on the heroic deeds of kings and warriors. The Epic of Gilgamesh itself is an example of this, as it recounts the feats of the warrior-king Gilgamesh. This answer choice also takes into account the societal changes that led to the glorification of warriors and their deeds, which are common themes in epic poetry.\n\nBased on these considerations, the best answer is:\n\nD.

Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright © 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?", "choices": ["The colonization of the interior of Africa", "The conquest of the Aztec Empire", "The reformation of Catholic Christianity", "The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that helped Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E., we need to identify an event or process that significantly increased Western Europe's productivity by exploiting resources from outside their own continent.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa: While this was significant in the later stages of European imperialism, it was not a major factor during the period 1450-1750 C.E. for the quantum jump in productivity as the transatlantic slave trade and exploitation of African resources became more prominent in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire: This event occurred in the early 16th century (around 1521) when Hernán Cortés conquered the Aztec Empire in Mexico. This conquest led to the acquisition of vast amounts of gold and silver, which fueled the Spanish economy and contributed to the wealth and power of Western Europe. It also opened up new lands for agriculture, such as sugar plantations, which were highly profitable. This is a strong candidate for supporting the author's assertion.\n\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity: This religious movement, while significant in reshaping European politics and society, did not directly contribute to the exploitation of resources or the increase in productivity that the author refers to.\n\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan: This policy of Japan closing itself off to most foreign contact actually hindered, rather than facilitated, Western Europe's ability to exploit resources and increase productivity through external means.\n\nGiven these considerations, the conquest of the Aztec Empire (Option B) best supports the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that helped Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E. This event provided Western Europe with substantial resources and land that were crucial for increasing productivity and achieving global dominance during this time period."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.\nFirstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…\n…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.\"\nMartin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520\nWhen the author of the passage above discusses the \"second wall,\" to what is he referring?", "choices": ["The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate definition of \"Holy Ghost\"", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate theological belief about the divinity of Jesus", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate method of baptism"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "The author of the passage, Martin Luther, when discussing the \"second wall,\" is referring to B. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts. In the passage, Luther criticizes the Romanists (Catholics) for claiming that only the Pope has the authority to interpret the Scriptures, which he sees as an attempt to maintain their power and control over religious understanding. This is part of his broader argument against the corruption and abuse of power within the Catholic Church during the Reformation period."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"My little homestead in the city, which I recently insured for ￡2,000 would no doubt have shared the common fate, as the insurance companies will not make good that which is destroyed by the Queen's enemies. And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around.\"\nLetter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879\nIncidents such as those described by the author of the letter were used by the British government to do which of the following?", "choices": ["Issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu", "Tax the Zulu kingdom to cover damages attributed to them", "Sever its responsibility to protect citizens who chose to live in South Africa", "Liberate the Zulus from British colonialism"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "The incidents described in the letter were likely used by the British government to justify their military actions and presence in South Africa during the Anglo-Zulu War. The letter mentions damage done by a contingent of natives, which could be interpreted as an attack on British property and interests. This could have been used as evidence of the need for British intervention and protection of its citizens and assets. Therefore, the most plausible use of such incidents by the British government would be:\n\nA. Issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu\n\nThis aligns with historical context, as the British often cited the need to protect their citizens and interests as justification for military action and expansion during colonial times."}
