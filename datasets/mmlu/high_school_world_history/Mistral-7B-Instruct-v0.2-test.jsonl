{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?", "choices": ["They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.", "They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.", "They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.", "They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology."], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": " C. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\n\nThe passage suggests that the Chinese military focused on improving horse archer units because they faced mobile steppe nomads as their primary threat, and early gunpowder weapons were unwieldy and not effective against such opponents. Therefore, it was a logical decision for them to invest in weapons that were better suited to their military situation at the time."}

However, we can make some inferences based on historical context.\n\nThe Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 in Australia was enacted to restrict the immigration of certain groups, including laborers. At the time, Australia was experiencing a boom in industries such as gold mining, agriculture, and infrastructure development, which required a large labor force. Chinese laborers were a significant portion of the workforce in these industries, particularly in gold mining and construction.\n\nSimilarly, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 in the United States was enacted to restrict the immigration of Chinese laborers. The United States was experiencing an economic boom during this period, particularly in industries such as mining, railroad construction, and agriculture. Chinese laborers were a significant portion of the workforce in these industries, particularly in mining and railroad construction.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to infer that the economic activities that drove the rising levels of immigration and led to the enactment of these laws were likely to be industries that required a large labor force and relied heavily on immigrant labor, such as mining, railroad construction, and agriculture. Based on this information, options A, B, C, and D (railroad construction, fertilizer harvesting, sugarcane production, and gold mining, respectively) could all be potential answers. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to definitively determine which economic activity drove the rising levels of immigration the most."}

Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H.

The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n—Robert Guisepi, 1992\nThe Mongol empire used which of the following to integrate its vast, geographically diverse area?", "choices": ["Emphasis on trade networks", "Expansion of bureaucracy to reinforce dominance", "The use of state-sponsored religion to legitimize the government", "Expansion of an interregional canal system"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": " Based on the information provided, the answer is A.

She argues that women have not received any real benefits from the Revolution and urges them to fight for their rights.\n\nIn the second passage, Halima Ghomri is reflecting on the lack of progress for women in Algeria after the country's war of independence.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?", "choices": ["The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India", "British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company", "Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority", "The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government"], "answer": 3, "model_answer": 3, "completion": " Based on the information provided in the passages, the outcome in the short term was D. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government.\n\nThe passages describe the Cawnpore massacres during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, where Indian soldiers turned against their British officers and killed them, along with women and children. The British were shocked and outraged by this violence, as it challenged their monopoly on violence and their superiority over the Indian population. The passages also describe how the rebellion was fueled by a desire for religious and racial freedom, as well as a desire to overthrow British rule.\n\nHowever, despite the intensity and widespread nature of the rebellion, the British ultimately emerged victorious. The passages do not mention any significant Indian military successes or gains towards independence, and instead describe the British response as one of reasserting their control through direct rule. Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nEvery two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nMao's quotation is best understood in the context of which of the following?", "choices": ["Governments in communist countries implementing liberal political and economic reforms to mitigate social unrest", "Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population", "Governments promoting policies intended to hasten industrialization", "Governments promoting capitalist policies to reduce inequality between sectors of the population"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": " Based on the information provided in Mao Zedong's quotation, the best answer is:\n\nB. Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population.\n\nIn the quotation, Mao is discussing the issue of increasing inequality between rich and poor peasants in the countryside of China. He argues that the current situation, where some peasants are becoming richer while others remain in poverty, will lead to social unrest and the breakdown of the worker-peasant alliance. Mao believes that the only solution is to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, which includes the elimination of the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside, and the implementation of cooperation to ensure that all rural people will become increasingly well off together. This is a clear reference to collectivization of the land, which was a key policy in communist China aimed at reducing inequality and increasing agricultural productivity."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?", "choices": ["How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other", "Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era", "Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.", "How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 0, "completion": " A. How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n\nExplanation:\nThe passage discusses how Europe and China approached the use of gunpowder weaponry during the medieval period and how their different military needs influenced the development of this technology in each region. It highlights that Europe found gunpowder weapons useful in prolonged sieges, leading to their improvement and widespread use, while China, facing mobile steppe nomads, focused on improving horse archer units instead. This shows an example of how societies adopted or rejected certain technologies based on their strategic needs and circumstances, making option A the best answer."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nEvery two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute.

At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River.
