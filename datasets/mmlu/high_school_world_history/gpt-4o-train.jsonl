This indicates a significant flow of silver into China, which was a major aspect of the global trade network at the time.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants**: This option is relevant because if Europeans found goods that the Chinese wanted, it could alter the trade balance. Historically, this happened with the introduction of opium by the British, which led to the Opium Wars and significantly changed trade patterns.\n\nB. **Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas**: While these revolutions had profound political and social impacts, they did not directly affect the specific trade patterns between Europe and East Asia described in the passage.\n\nC. **The Industrial Revolution**: The Industrial Revolution led to increased production and technological advancements in Europe. It also resulted in European countries seeking new markets and resources, which could indirectly affect trade patterns. However, it does not directly address the specific trade of silver and goods between China, Japan, and the Portuguese.\n\nD. **The colonization of Africa**: This primarily involved European powers exploiting African resources and did not directly impact the trade dynamics between Europe and East Asia as described in the passage.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most direct development that undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph is:\n\n**A. The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants**\n\nThis is because the introduction of opium by the British led to a significant shift in trade dynamics, resulting in the Opium Wars and the eventual opening of China to more European trade, thereby altering the previous trade patterns."}

These roles often provided women with a certain degree of influence and visibility within their communities.\n\nWith the advent of sedentary societies, which began around 10,000 B.C.E. with the development of agriculture, there was a significant shift in social structures. Sedentary societies led to the establishment of more rigid social hierarchies and gender roles. In these societies, women's roles became more confined to the domestic sphere, focusing on household management, child-rearing, and supporting their husbands. This shift often resulted in women having less public influence and power compared to their roles in earlier, more egalitarian societies.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Women were increasingly thought of as primary earners for the family.\n- This is not accurate for the period in question. In sedentary societies, men were typically seen as the primary earners or providers, especially in agricultural and later industrial contexts.\n\nB. Women were increasingly responsible for the care of their children.\n- While this is true, it does not directly address the restriction of women's lives compared to their roles in earlier societies.\n\nC. Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere.\n- This is accurate. As sedentary societies developed, women's roles became more confined to the domestic sphere, limiting their public influence and power.\n\nD. Women's power increasingly fell within the public sphere.\n- This is incorrect. The trend was the opposite, with women's influence becoming more restricted to the private, domestic sphere.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere."}

The formation of the non-aligned movement: The Bandung Conference is widely recognized as a precursor to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). The NAM was established to create a bloc of countries that did not formally align with either the United States or the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Sukarno's emphasis on peace, independence, and the collective strength of Asian and African countries aligns well with the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement.\n\nB. Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation: While the passage does emphasize peace, it does not specifically mention disarmament or nuclear non-proliferation. The focus is more on the broader concept of peace and the role of Asian and African countries in promoting it.\n\nC. The Green Revolution in agriculture: The Green Revolution refers to a series of research, development, and technology transfer initiatives that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in the developing world, starting in the 1940s and continuing into the 1960s and beyond. The passage does not mention agriculture or technological advancements in farming.\n\nD.

The verse from the Qur'an (Sura 5: 89) clearly prohibits the consumption of strong drink and participation in games of chance, labeling them as \"infamy of Satan's handiwork\" and advising believers to avoid them to succeed.\n\n2. The verse from the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, on the other hand, encourages the enjoyment of wine, suggesting that the time when roses are in bloom is the right moment to pour and enjoy wine.\n\nGiven these two contrasting perspectives, we can draw the following conclusions:\n\nA. Many Muslims inclined toward atheism in the premodern era.\n- This conclusion is not directly supported by the verses. The verses discuss behavior and practices rather than belief in God or atheism.\n\nB. Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims.\n- This conclusion is supported by the verses. The Qur'an prohibits certain behaviors, while the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, a work by a Muslim poet, suggests engaging in one of those prohibited behaviors (drinking wine). This indicates that not all Muslims adhered strictly to the religious restrictions.\n\nC. Christian missionaries were steadily winning converts among Muslim populations.\n- There is no evidence in the verses to support this conclusion. The verses do not mention Christian missionaries or conversion.\n\nD. Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice.\n- This conclusion is too broad and not directly supported by the verses. While Omar Khayyám's verse suggests a more liberal attitude towards wine, it does not indicate a general hostility towards traditional religious practice among all Muslim intellectuals.\n\nTherefore, the best-supported conclusion is:\n\nB. Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims."}

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": ["Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown", "Killing of civilians during wartime", "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction", "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To determine the best connection between the passages and the forms of violence listed, we need to analyze the content and context provided by both excerpts.\n\n1. **William Howard Russell's Diary (1860)**:\n   - Russell describes the Cawnpore massacres as a violent uprising by the Indian subjects against their British rulers.\n   - He emphasizes the racial and religious dimensions of the violence, noting that it was a revolt against colonial domination.\n   - The violence targeted British men, women, and children, indicating a deliberate and systematic approach to killing civilians.\n\n2. **Rudrangshu Mukherjee's Analysis (1990)**:\n   - Mukherjee discusses the inherent violence of British colonial rule in India, highlighting the monopoly of violence held by the British.\n   - He explains that the 1857 revolt shattered this monopoly by introducing indigenous violence against the colonizers.\n   - The violence is framed as a response to the dehumanizing treatment of Indians by the British, who were seen as superior and civilized.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown**:\n   - This does not fit well, as the violence described is not random or due to socio-economic breakdown but is rather organized and politically motivated.\n\nB. **Killing of civilians during wartime**:\n   - This is a strong candidate. Both passages describe the deliberate killing of civilians (British men, women, and children) during the 1857 revolt, which can be seen as a wartime scenario.\n\nC. **Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction**:\n   - This is not applicable, as the violence described is direct and intentional, not collateral damage from indiscriminate weapons.\n\nD. **State-sponsored campaigns of genocide**:\n   - While the violence is systematic and targets a specific group, it is not state-sponsored genocide. The violence is carried out by rebels against the colonial state, not by a state apparatus against its own or another population.\n\nTherefore, the best connection between the passages and the forms of violence listed is:\n\n**B.

The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations\n- This option directly involves Western European capitalists who expanded the slave trade to benefit their economic interests in the Caribbean. The slave trade is a clear example of how African wealth (in the form of human labor) was drained to support European economic activities, aligning with Rodney's argument.\n\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market\n- While this option involves the exploitation of African resources, it does not directly implicate Western European capitalists.

The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company\n- This option involves European colonization and exploitation of African resources. The Dutch East India Company was a capitalist enterprise from Western Europe, and its establishment of Cape Colony represents European economic interests in Africa. This supports Rodney's argument but is less directly related to the broader context of draining African wealth compared to the slave trade.\n\nD. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia\n- This option describes trade relations but does not necessarily imply exploitation or draining of African wealth.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism.

The speech emphasizes the need to overcome backwardness in various sectors such as military, cultural, political, industrial, and agricultural. Stalin argues that backwardness has historically led to Russia being beaten by various foreign powers. He stresses the importance of not lagging behind to avoid being exploited and beaten.\n\nLet's analyze each option in this context:\n\nA. **Stalin's drive to motivate Soviet industry for the Winter War with Finland**: The Winter War took place between 1939 and 1940. While motivating industry for war could be relevant, the speech does not specifically mention Finland or a war context. The focus is more on general backwardness and the need for comprehensive development.\n\nB. **Stalin's push to make the Soviet Union a nuclear nation**: The Soviet Union's nuclear program began in earnest after World War II, particularly in the late 1940s and early 1950s. This speech, delivered in 1931, predates those efforts and does not mention nuclear capabilities.\n\nC. **Stalin's implementation of five-year plans for the Soviet economy**: The first Five-Year Plan was launched in 1928 and aimed at rapid industrialization and collectivization of agriculture. The speech's emphasis on overcoming backwardness in various sectors aligns well with the goals of the Five-Year Plans, which sought to transform the Soviet Union into a modern industrial power.\n\nD. **Stalin's purges of dissidents and other political prisoners**: The Great Purge occurred in the late 1930s, primarily from 1936 to 1938.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

Revere these warnings in your person. . . . The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries. If you not be virtuous, be it in large things or in small, it will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple.\"\n—Excerpted and adapted from the Shu Jing, 6th century BCE, China\nWhat does the phrase below tell us about the ruler?", "choices": ["He had the Mandate of Heaven.", "He was an absolute monarch.", "He had lost the blessing of the gods.", "He was killed as a result of natural disasters."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the phrase in question and the context provided by the excerpt.\n\nThe phrase to consider is: \"Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor.\"\n\n1. **Mandate of Heaven**: In ancient Chinese belief, the Mandate of Heaven was a divine approval granted to just and virtuous rulers. If a ruler was just and virtuous, they were believed to have the Mandate of Heaven, which legitimized their rule. Conversely, if a ruler was unjust or corrupt, they would lose this mandate, and calamities or disasters would be seen as signs of this loss.\n\n2. **Absolute Monarch**: This term refers to a ruler with complete and unrestricted power. The phrase does not provide information about the extent of the ruler's power.\n\n3. **Lost the blessing of the gods**: This would imply that the ruler was no longer favored by the divine powers, often resulting in misfortune or calamities.\n\n4. **Killed as a result of natural disasters**: This would imply that the ruler died due to natural calamities, but the phrase does not mention the ruler's death.\n\nGiven the phrase \"Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor,\" it suggests that the ruler initially had the favor of Heaven (the Mandate of Heaven). The calamities were sent down as a result of the ruler's actions, indicating a potential loss of this favor due to misdeeds or lack of virtue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. He had the Mandate of Heaven."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities.

Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance).\n- This option is plausible. The Mongol rule over Russia, known as the \"Mongol Yoke,\" isolated Russia from many of the cultural and intellectual developments occurring in Western Europe, including the Renaissance.\n\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.\n- This option is not accurate. The administrative center of Mongol political activity was not in Russia but rather in places like Karakorum and later in China under the Yuan Dynasty.\n\nC. Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.\n- This option is incorrect. While Islam did spread in some regions under Mongol rule, it did not become the dominant religion in Russia, which remained predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christian.\n\nD. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\n- This option is partially correct but not the most accurate. While the Mongol influence did contribute to the development of a more centralized state in Russia, it was not the primary long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia is:\n\nA. Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance)."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBut the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?", "choices": ["Tang and Ottoman", "Ming and Aztec", "Han and Gupta", "Qin and Etruscan"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "The passage by Edward Gibbon attributes the fall of the Roman Empire to internal decay caused by its own greatness, the corruption and relaxation of military discipline, and the eventual overwhelming by external forces (Barbarians). These reasons can be applied to other classical empires that experienced similar patterns of internal decline and external pressures.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Tang and Ottoman**: The Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) in China did experience internal strife and external pressures, but it is not typically classified as a classical empire. The Ottoman Empire, while it did face internal decay and external pressures, is also not considered a classical empire as it rose to prominence much later (14th century onwards).\n\nB. **Ming and Aztec**: The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD) in China and the Aztec Empire (c. 1345-1521 AD) in Mesoamerica both faced internal issues and external threats, but they are not considered classical empires. The Ming Dynasty came after the classical period, and the Aztec Empire, while pre-Columbian, does not fit the classical category either.\n\nC. **Han and Gupta**: The Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) in China and the Gupta Empire (c. 320-550 AD) in India are both considered classical empires. The Han Dynasty faced internal corruption, weakening of military discipline, and invasions by nomadic tribes (similar to the Barbarians in Rome). The Gupta Empire also experienced internal decay and invasions by the Huns, leading to its decline.\n\nD. **Qin and Etruscan**: The Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC) in China, while significant, was short-lived and does not fit the pattern of long-term internal decay and external pressure. The Etruscan civilization, which predated the Roman Republic, does not fit the classical empire category and did not experience a decline similar to that described in the passage.\n\nGiven this analysis, the reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire as described in the passage are most applicable to the Han and Gupta empires.\n\n**Final Verdict: C. Han and Gupta**"}

The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems:\n- This option highlights the importance of literacy and the role of scribes in recording literature. In ancient Mesopotamia, scribes were indeed crucial for documenting various texts, including epic poetry. The development of writing systems like cuneiform allowed for the preservation of such works.\n\nB. The rise of a merchant class in cities who could sponsor the creation of original art:\n- While merchants played a significant role in the economy and could sponsor art, this option does not directly relate to the origins of epic poetry. Epic poetry often predates the significant influence of a merchant class and is more closely tied to the deeds of rulers and heroes.\n\nC. The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings:\n- Religious figures did play a role in recording history and mythology, but epic poetry like the Epic of Gilgamesh is more focused on the heroic deeds and attributes of rulers rather than solely religious documentation.\n\nD. The rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording:\n- Epic poetry often centers around the heroic deeds, adventures, and attributes of rulers and warriors. The Epic of Gilgamesh, for example, celebrates the king's divine attributes, his construction projects, and his heroic quests. This suggests that the origins of such poetry are closely tied to the desire to immortalize the deeds of a warrior elite.\n\nGiven the context of the Epic of Gilgamesh and the nature of epic poetry, the best answer is:\n\nD.

The conquest of the Aztec Empire: This event occurred in the early 16th century (1519-1521) and involved the exploitation of the Aztec Empire's resources, including gold and silver, which significantly increased the wealth and productivity of Spain, a Western European power. This aligns with the author's points about exploiting ecosystems and mineral resources.\n\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity: While the Reformation was a significant event in European history, it was primarily a religious and political movement within Europe and did not directly involve the exploitation of external ecosystems, mineral resources, or human assets.\n\nD.
