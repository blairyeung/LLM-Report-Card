Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere.\n\nThe text emphasizes the importance of a woman's domestic duties, such as managing the household, performing tasks, and attending to her own affairs. It also stresses the need for a woman to be correct in manner and upright in character in order to serve her husband. This suggests that women's roles were largely confined to the private sphere, with a focus on domestic responsibilities and family obligations.\n\nIn contrast, before the advent of sedentary societies, women may have had more freedom and autonomy, as they were often involved in hunting, gathering, and other economic activities. With the rise of sedentary societies, women's roles became more restricted to domestic duties, and their power and influence were largely confined to the private sphere.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that women were increasingly thought of as primary earners for the family during this period. In fact, the text suggests that a woman's primary role is to serve her husband and manage the household.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because while women may have been responsible for caring for their children, this is not a unique characteristic of sedentary societies. Women have always played a significant role in childcare across cultures.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the text does not suggest that women's power increased within the public sphere during this period.

A widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I.\n\nIn Source 1, Adolf Hitler is quoted as saying that the Treaty of Versailles was not a law to Germany because it was obtained through force and coercion, rather than through peaceful negotiation. This suggests that Hitler and many Germans believed that the treaty was unfair and that Germany had been treated harshly at the end of World War I.\n\nThis belief was widespread in Germany during the 1920s and 1930s, and was fueled by the economic and territorial losses that Germany had suffered as a result of the war. The treaty imposed harsh penalties on Germany, including significant reparations and territorial losses, which many Germans felt were unjust and contributed to their economic and political instability.\n\nHitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles was a key part of his political platform, and he used it to rally support among Germans who felt that their country had been unfairly treated. By portraying the treaty as a symbol of German humiliation and oppression, Hitler was able to tap into these feelings and build a sense of national grievance that helped to fuel his rise to power.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and D do not provide a sufficient historical background for Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles. While Poland's territorial borders were certainly an issue during the 1930s, there is no evidence to suggest that Hitler's condemnation of the treaty was specifically motivated by a desire to protect Poland's borders. Similarly, while intolerance of ethnic and political minority groups was certainly a feature of Nazi ideology, it is not directly related to Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles. Finally, while Hitler did collaborate with Benito Mussolini, there is no evidence to suggest that this collaboration was motivated by a desire to condemn the Treaty of Versailles."}

Hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\nThe Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia) and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States) both demonstrate a growing trend of restricting immigration and excluding certain groups of people from entering the country. The Australian act prohibits the immigration of \"prohibited immigrants\" who are deemed to be a charge on the public or who are under contract to perform manual labor. The US act, on the other hand, suspends the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States and makes it illegal for Chinese laborers to enter or remain in the country.\n\nBoth acts reflect a hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment, where governments are taking steps to restrict immigration and exclude certain groups of people from entering the country. This trend is evident in the language used in the acts, which emphasizes the need to protect the country from the perceived threats posed by immigrants.\n\nIn contrast, the other options do not accurately reflect the trend demonstrated in the passages. The rise of anti-Semitic ideologies is not evident in the passages, and trade protectionism is not a direct result of the acts. A growing desire to attract skilled labor from abroad is actually the opposite of what is happening in the passages, where governments are restricting immigration and excluding certain groups of people."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": ["Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown", "Killing of civilians during wartime", "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction", "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "After considering the passages, I would argue that the correct answer is D. State-sponsored campaigns of genocide.\n\nThe passages describe the Cawnpore massacres as a war of revenge, a war of race, and a war of religion, where the leaders of the revolt sought to destroy every white man, woman, or child who fell into their hands. The passages also highlight the hierarchical and racialized nature of British rule in India, where the British treated Indians as inferior and denied them \"humanness\". This suggests that the violence was not simply a result of individual actions or banditry, but rather a systematic and organized campaign of violence perpetrated by the colonized against the colonizers.\n\nThe passages also emphasize the monopoly of violence enjoyed by the British, which was shattered by the revolt of 1857. This suggests that the violence was not simply a result of collateral damage or killing of civilians during wartime, but rather a deliberate and calculated attempt to challenge the dominant power structure.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting category for the violence described in the passages is state-sponsored campaigns of genocide, which involves the systematic and organized killing of a group of people, often based on their race, ethnicity, or nationality."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.\nFirstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…\n…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.\"\nMartin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520\nWhen the author of the passage above discusses the \"second wall,\" to what is he referring?", "choices": ["The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate definition of \"Holy Ghost\"", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate theological belief about the divinity of Jesus", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate method of baptism"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "Based on the passage, I would argue that the correct answer is B. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts.\n\nThe author, Martin Luther, is criticizing the Catholic Church's stance on biblical interpretation, stating that they alone pretend to be masters of the Scriptures, despite not learning anything from them. He is highlighting the Catholic Church's claim that only the Pope can interpret the Scriptures, which Luther sees as an attempt to suppress any potential reform or criticism."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"My little homestead in the city, which I recently insured for ￡2,000 would no doubt have shared the common fate, as the insurance companies will not make good that which is destroyed by the Queen's enemies. And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around.\"\nLetter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879\nIncidents such as those described by the author of the letter were used by the British government to do which of the following?", "choices": ["Issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu", "Tax the Zulu kingdom to cover damages attributed to them", "Sever its responsibility to protect citizens who chose to live in South Africa", "Liberate the Zulus from British colonialism"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "Based on the letter, it seems that the British government is being held responsible for the damages caused by the Zulu natives to the author's property. The author is suing the government for damages, which suggests that the government is being held accountable for the actions of the Zulu people.\n\nGiven this context, I would argue that the correct answer is:\n\nA. Issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu\n\nThe author's letter is likely being used as evidence to justify the British government's decision to go to war with the Zulu kingdom. The author's property has been damaged, and the government is being held responsible, which provides a pretext for the British to declare war on the Zulu kingdom."}
