A widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I\n\nExplanation:\n\nAdolf Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles in Source 1 refers to Germany's belief that it had been unfairly treated after World War I. The Treaty of Versailles was a peace treaty signed in 1919, which ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. Germany was held responsible for the war and was forced to pay reparations, surrender territory, and disarm its military. This treaty was deeply resented by many Germans, who felt that it imposed harsh and humiliating terms on their country. Hitler and the Nazi Party capitalized on this resentment and used it as a rallying cry to gain support for their political agenda, which ultimately led to the outbreak of World War II.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.\n\nThe passage mentions that the king wears necklaces made of gold and bracelets made of gold on his forearms. While it is not explicitly stated that the gold came from Asia, it is reasonable to assume that it did, as gold was a valuable commodity that was often traded between Asia and Africa during this time period. Therefore, the king's adornment with gold provides evidence that the Ghanians were engaged in trade with Asia."}

The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or \"Sea of Precious Virtues,\" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.\nRobert Irwin, \"Islam and the Crusades,\" 1995\nIt is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them.

This behavior does not align with the idea that Muslims were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent or that they were only interested in expanding their territory at the expense of others. Instead, it suggests that there were peaceful interactions between Muslims and Christians during the crusading era.\n\nTherefore, the information provided in the passage supports option D, that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era, but it also challenges the assumption that this ideology led to inherent violence towards non-Muslims. The first passage, which emphasizes the obligation of jihad and the duty of Muslim rulers to prosecute it, does not necessarily contradict this interpretation, as it also acknowledges that some theorists argued for a defensive interpretation of jihad. Overall, the information provided suggests a more complex picture of Muslim-Christian relations during the crusading era than simple dichotomies of peacefulness or violence."}

The ideals of communism as stated by Joseph Stalin\n\nExplanation:\n\nMao Zedong's view of agricultural cooperation reflects the influence of communist ideology, specifically as it was articulated by Joseph Stalin. The idea of collectivizing agriculture and eliminating the individual economy in the countryside to ensure that all rural people become increasingly well-off together is a hallmark of communist thought. This is in contrast to the ideals of classical liberalism, which emphasizes individual freedom and property rights, or the ideals of the Enlightenment, which emphasize individual rights and reason, or the ideals of globalization, which emphasize free trade and interconnectedness between nations."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries.

Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy. The Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s led to the establishment of a well-policed realm where different peoples and religions lived together in peace. The Mongols promulgated a law code that ordered human interaction, which resulted in an important new stage in international contact. This contact facilitated the spread of new ideas, inventions, and foods, leading to economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life in Russia. The Mongols did not make Russia the administrative center of their political activity, and Islam was not the dominant religion in Russia during this time."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBut the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?", "choices": ["Tang and Ottoman", "Ming and Aztec", "Han and Gupta", "Qin and Etruscan"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": " C. Han and Gupta\n\nThe reasons given in the passage for the fall of the Roman Empire, such as the military becoming oppressive and mercenary, the relaxation of military vigor, and the eventual invasion by barbarians, can be paralleled with the fall of other classical empires. The Han and Gupta empires, in particular, share some similarities.\n\nThe Han Dynasty in China, for instance, experienced a period of great expansion and prosperity, which led to the growth of a large and powerful military. Over time, this military became a significant political force, leading to the decline of the central government and the eventual end of the Han Dynasty. The military's power was further consolidated by the emergence of warlords and the fragmentation of the empire.\n\nSimilarly, the Gupta Empire in India experienced a period of great cultural and economic prosperity, which led to the growth of a large and powerful military. However, as the empire expanded, the military became a significant political force, leading to the decline of the central government and the eventual end of the Gupta Empire. The military's power was further consolidated by the emergence of regional powers and the fragmentation of the empire.\n\nTherefore, the reasons given in the passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to the Han and Gupta empires. However, it is important to note that each empire had unique historical circumstances and causes for its decline."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Al-Zawawi also said 'This sultan Musa told me that at a town called ZKRY he has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. \"There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in.

We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer. The passage mentions that the copper is brought to BYTY from a town called ZKRY, and that duty is collected on this copper and nothing else. The gold that is obtained from the pagan nations in the kingdom is also mentioned, but it is not clear that it is obtained through conquest or the slave trade.
