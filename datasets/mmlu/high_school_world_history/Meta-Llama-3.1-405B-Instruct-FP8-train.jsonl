The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants: This development would likely change the trade patterns, as the Chinese would now be interested in buying goods from European merchants, rather than just selling goods to them in exchange for silver.\n\nB.

The colonization of Africa: The colonization of Africa is not directly related to the trade patterns between Europe and China.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants.\n\nThis development would most directly undo the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph, as it would change the dynamics of the trade relationship between European merchants and China. Specifically, the Opium Wars (1839-1842, 1856-1860) led to the forced opening of Chinese markets to European goods, including opium, which became a major export to China. This marked a significant shift in the trade patterns, as China was no longer just exporting goods in exchange for silver, but was now also importing goods from European merchants."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence.

This emphasis on unity and collective strength is a hallmark of Pan-Africanism, which seeks to unify and empower African nations and peoples.\n\n2. **Projection of African Personality**: By suggesting that a union of African states will project the African personality more effectively, Nkrumah is highlighting the importance of African identity and self-determination. This is also a key aspect of Pan-Africanism, which seeks to promote African culture, identity, and interests.\n\n3. **Critique of Great Powers**: Nkrumah criticizes the Great Powers for their disregard of African independence, citing examples such as the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the UN's ineffectiveness in the Congo. This critique of external interference and neocolonialism is consistent with Pan-Africanism's emphasis on African self-determination and resistance to external domination.\n\nConsidering these points, Nkrumah's argument does not clearly support Communism (B), African socialism (C), or Neocolonialism (D). While African socialism might share some similarities with Pan-Africanism, Nkrumah's emphasis on unity, identity, and self-determination makes Pan-Africanism the most fitting ideology.\n\n**Final Verdict:** A.

The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries\nA young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . .

The speaker, Sukarno, is addressing the Bandung Conference, a meeting of Asian and African nations in 1955.\n\nThe Bandung Conference is historically significant because it marked the beginning of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a group of nations that sought to maintain their independence and neutrality during the Cold War era.

This verse seems to celebrate the enjoyment of worldly pleasures, including drinking wine, which is directly opposed to the teaching in the Qur'an verse.\n\nConsidering these two verses together, we can infer that not all Muslims adhered strictly to the religious restrictions outlined in the Qur'an. The presence of literature like the Rubáiyát, which openly suggests engaging in prohibited activities, indicates a diversity of attitudes and behaviors within Muslim societies. This diversity suggests that religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims.\n\nThe best answer is B."}

The Australian act prohibits the entry of certain individuals, including those who cannot write in a European language, those who may become a public charge, and those under contract to perform manual labor. The U.S. act specifically targets Chinese laborers, suspending their entry into the country and imposing penalties on ship captains who bring them in.\n\nConsidering the content of these passages, we can see that they reflect a negative attitude towards immigration, particularly towards certain groups of people. There is no mention of anti-Semitic ideologies (A), trade protectionism (B), or a desire to attract skilled labor (C). Instead, the focus is on excluding or restricting certain groups of immigrants.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment\n\nThis answer is supported by the language and tone of the passages, which convey a sense of restriction and exclusion towards certain groups of immigrants.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": ["Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown", "Killing of civilians during wartime", "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction", "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To determine which form of violence is most closely connected to the passages, let's analyze the key points from each passage.\n\nThe first passage, written by William Howard Russell, describes the Cawnpore massacres during the Indian Mutiny of 1857. It highlights the brutal violence committed by Indian rebels against British civilians, including women and children. The passage suggests that the violence was motivated by a desire for revenge, hope, and nationalistic sentiments to overthrow British rule.\n\nThe second passage, written by Rudrangshu Mukherjee, provides a broader context for the violence. It argues that the British colonial rule in India was built on a monopoly of violence, which was used to maintain power and superiority over the Indian population. The passage also notes that the revolt of 1857 shattered this monopoly, leading to a violent response from the Indian rebels.\n\nConsidering these points, we can now evaluate the options:\n\nA. Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown: While the Indian Mutiny was certainly driven by socio-economic factors, the passages do not specifically describe banditry as the primary form of violence.\n\nB. Killing of civilians during wartime: This option is a strong candidate, as both passages describe the violence committed against British civilians, including women and children, during the Indian Mutiny.\n\nC. Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction: There is no mention of weapons of mass destruction in either passage, making this option unlikely.\n\nD. State-sponsored campaigns of genocide: While the British colonial rule was certainly violent and oppressive, the passages do not describe a state-sponsored campaign of genocide. Instead, they highlight the violence committed by Indian rebels against British civilians.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nB. Killing of civilians during wartime\n\nThis option best captures the essence of the violence described in both passages, which highlights the brutal attacks on British civilians, including women and children, during the Indian Mutiny of 1857."}

Specifically, it mentions that women should:\n\n* Perform domestic duties without complaint, whether easy or difficult\n* Attend to their own affairs and live in purity and quietness of spirit\n* Avoid gossip and silly laughter\n* Take care of the offerings to the ancestors\n\nThese points suggest that women are expected to take care of domestic duties, be virtuous, and prioritize their family responsibilities.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA. That they obediently fulfill their obligations within the home: This option aligns with the passage's emphasis on women performing domestic duties without complaint and taking care of their family responsibilities.\n\nB. That they collaborate with their husbands on domestic tasks: The passage does not mention collaboration with husbands on domestic tasks. Instead, it focuses on women's individual responsibilities.\n\nC. That they pursue education in order to find meaningful employment: The passage does not mention education or employment outside the home.\n\nD. That they speak their minds boldly: The passage actually advises women to avoid gossip and silly laughter, suggesting that they should be quiet and reserved.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism.

Stalin references Russia's history of being beaten by various groups due to its backwardness, and he argues that this is a result of the \"jungle law of capitalism.\" He concludes by stating that the Soviet Union must no longer lag behind.\n\nConsidering the time period (1931) and the content of the speech, it is likely that Stalin is referring to the Soviet Union's economic development and its need to rapidly industrialize. This was a key aspect of Stalin's policies during this period, particularly with the introduction of the five-year plans.\n\nThe five-year plans were a series of economic plans implemented by Stalin to rapidly industrialize the Soviet Union and make it a major economic power.

The Winter War with Finland did not occur until 1939, and Stalin's push to make the Soviet Union a nuclear nation did not begin until the 1940s.

They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n—Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich of the following was a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s?", "choices": ["Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance).", "Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.", "Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.", "Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided and consider the potential consequences of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s.\n\nFirst, the passage describes the Mongol Empire as a vast realm where once-hostile peoples lived together in peace, and virtually all religions were tolerated. This suggests that the Mongols were not interested in imposing their own culture or religion on the conquered territories, but rather in maintaining stability and facilitating trade and cultural exchange.\n\nOption A, \"Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance),\" is a plausible consequence of the Mongol conquest. The Mongols did disrupt trade and cultural exchange between Eastern Europe and Western Europe, which could have isolated Russia from Western European developments.\n\nOption B, \"Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity,\" is unlikely. While the Mongols did establish administrative centers in their conquered territories, there is no evidence to suggest that Russia became a central hub of Mongol political activity.\n\nOption C, \"Islam became the dominant religion of Russia,\" is also unlikely. The passage states that the Mongols tolerated virtually all religions, and there is no evidence to suggest that they imposed Islam on Russia.\n\nOption D, \"Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy,\" is possible, but not necessarily a direct consequence of the Mongol conquest. The Mongols did establish administrative systems in their conquered territories, but it's unclear whether this would have led to the development of a centralized bureaucracy in Russia.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s is that Russia was excluded from Western European developments, such as the Renaissance.\n\nFinal verdict: A."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBut the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?", "choices": ["Tang and Ottoman", "Ming and Aztec", "Han and Gupta", "Qin and Etruscan"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the reasons given in the passage for the fall of the Roman Empire:\n\n1. Immoderate greatness leading to decay\n2. Conquest and expansion leading to multiplication of destructive causes\n3. Corruption of military discipline\n4. External pressures from barbarian invasions\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA. Tang and Ottoman: The Tang Dynasty in China and the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East were both vast and powerful empires that expanded through conquest. They both faced external pressures and had complex military systems that could be vulnerable to corruption. This option seems plausible.\n\nB. Ming and Aztec: The Ming Dynasty in China was known for its isolationism and internal decay, but it's not clear how well the Aztec Empire fits the description in the passage. The Aztecs were a relatively small empire that was conquered by the Spanish, rather than facing a gradual decline.\n\nC. Han and Gupta: The Han Dynasty in China and the Gupta Empire in India were both classical empires that faced external pressures and had complex military systems. However, the passage's emphasis on \"immoderate greatness\" and \"conquest\" might not fit the Gupta Empire, which was relatively smaller and more decentralized.\n\nD. Qin and Etruscan: The Qin Dynasty in China was a short-lived empire that was known for its centralized power and military conquests. However, the Etruscan civilization was a smaller, regional power that doesn't fit the description in the passage.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would argue that the reasons given in the passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to the Tang and Ottoman empires, which were both large, complex, and expansionist powers that faced external pressures and internal decay.\n\nFinal verdict: A. Tang and Ottoman."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Al-Zawawi also said 'This sultan Musa told me that at a town called ZKRY he has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. \"There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in.

We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits.

This implies that the kingdom's wealth came from other sources.\n\nOption A, \"Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals,\" is supported by the passage, which mentions the copper mine and the extraction of gold from deposits. The fact that the kingdom levies a duty on copper and sells it for gold also suggests that minerals were an important source of wealth.\n\nOption B, \"Mali's wealth came in large part from its conquest of pagan neighbors,\" is not supported by the passage. While the passage mentions \"pagan nations\" in the kingdom, it does not suggest that conquest was a significant source of wealth.\n\nOption C, \"Mali's wealth came in large part from large agricultural estates,\" is not mentioned in the passage at all.\n\nOption D, \"Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade,\" is also not mentioned in the passage.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA.

The poem describes Gilgamesh's divine origins, his accomplishments, and the city of Uruk. The text suggests that the epic poem was written to praise Gilgamesh's greatness and to commemorate his achievements.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems: This option is plausible because the Epic of Gilgamesh was written in cuneiform script, which suggests that a literate class of scribes was present in ancient Mesopotamia. The existence of a literate class would have enabled the recording of poems, including epic poems like the Epic of Gilgamesh.\n\nB. The rise of a merchant class in cities who could sponsor the creation of original art: While the rise of a merchant class may have contributed to the development of art and literature, there is no direct evidence in the text to suggest that merchants sponsored the creation of the Epic of Gilgamesh.\n\nC. The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings: The text does describe Gilgamesh's divine origins and his relationship with the gods, but it does not suggest that a religious caste was solely responsible for recording the deeds of God-Kings.\n\nD. The rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording: While Gilgamesh is described as a great king and warrior, the text does not suggest that the epic poem was written solely to praise the deeds of a warrior elite.\n\nBased on the analysis, I conclude that the best answer is:\n\nA.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests.

The colonization of the interior of Africa: While this would provide access to new resources and labor, it's not clear if this would be enough to support a \"quantum jump\" in productivity, especially since the colonization of Africa was a gradual process that occurred over several centuries.\n\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire: This event would provide the conquering society (in this case, Spain) with access to vast resources, including gold, silver, and labor. The Aztec Empire was a major power in the Americas, and its conquest would have provided a significant boost to the Spanish economy. This option seems promising.\n\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity: While the Protestant Reformation had significant social, cultural, and political impacts, it's not clear how it would directly lead to a \"quantum jump\" in productivity. The Reformation was primarily a theological and ideological movement, rather than an economic or technological one.\n\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan: This option is actually counterintuitive to the author's assertion. Isolationism would limit Japan's access to external resources and labor, making it less likely to achieve a \"quantum jump\" in productivity.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer is:\n\nB.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.\nFirstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…\n…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only.

Luther also criticizes the Catholic doctrine that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, which he believes is unsupported by Scripture.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is clear that the \"second wall\" refers to the differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts.
