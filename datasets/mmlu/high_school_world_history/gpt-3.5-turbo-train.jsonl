The passage also mentions the restrictions placed on Portuguese traders in Canton, China. \n\nThe development from the period 1750–1900 C.E. that most directly undid these trade patterns would be the Industrial Revolution (option C). The Industrial Revolution brought about significant advancements in technology, transportation, and manufacturing processes in Europe. This led to the mass production of goods, increased efficiency in production, and the development of new markets. \n\nAs a result of the Industrial Revolution, European countries were able to produce goods more efficiently and at a lower cost than before. This shift in production capabilities and the rise of industrial economies in Europe altered global trade patterns. European countries began to export manufactured goods in exchange for raw materials and resources from other regions, including China and India. This shift in trade dynamics disrupted the traditional patterns of trade described in the passage, where goods like silk, gold, musk, and porcelain were exchanged for silver and other European products.\n\nTherefore, the Industrial Revolution had a significant impact on global trade patterns and directly undid the trade dynamics described in the passage from the period 1750–1900 C.E."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": ["Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown", "Killing of civilians during wartime", "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction", "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "The passages provided describe the violence that occurred during the Indian Mutiny of 1857, particularly focusing on the Cawnpore massacres. The violence described involves a rebellion against British colonial rule in India, where indigenous people rose up against their colonizers.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nMao's view of the cooperation of peasant labor most directly reflects the influence of which of the following?", "choices": ["The ideals of communism as stated by Joseph Stalin", "The ideals of the Enlightenment as stated by political revolutionaries such as Maximilian Robespierre", "The ideals of classical liberalism as stated by Adam Smith", "The ideals of globalization as evidenced by multinational trade blocs such as NAFTA or the European Union"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "Mao Zedong's view of the cooperation of peasant labor most directly reflects the ideals of communism as stated by Joseph Stalin.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n—Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich of the following was a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s?", "choices": ["Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance).", "Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.", "Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.", "Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "The Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s had significant long-term consequences for the region. One of the key impacts was the establishment of the Mongol-dominated Golden Horde, which ruled over parts of Russia for several centuries. This rule had a lasting influence on Russian political and social structures.\n\nOption A, stating that Russia was excluded from Western European developments like the Renaissance, is not directly related to the Mongol conquest of Russia. The Mongol rule did not necessarily isolate Russia from Western influences, although it did have its own distinct impact on the region.\n\nOption B, suggesting that Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity, is not accurate. While the Mongols did establish their administrative center in Russia, it was not necessarily a benefit for the Russian people. The Mongol rule brought about significant changes in governance and administration, but it was not a direct benefit for Russia.\n\nOption C, claiming that Islam became the dominant religion of Russia, is also incorrect. The Mongol rule did not lead to the widespread adoption of Islam in Russia. While the Mongols themselves were largely tolerant of different religions, they did not impose Islam as the dominant religion in the region.\n\nOption D, stating that Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy, is the most accurate choice. The Mongol rule introduced administrative structures and practices that influenced the development of centralized bureaucracy in Russia. The Mongols implemented systems of taxation, governance, and administration that had a lasting impact on Russian political organization.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s is that Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy (Option D)."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBut the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.

That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now.
