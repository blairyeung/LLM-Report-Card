{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?", "choices": ["They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.", "They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.", "They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.", "They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology."], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "The passage provides a comparison between the development and use of gunpowder weaponry in Western Europe and China from the 1200s to the 1400s. It explains that in Western Europe, early cannons were useful in sieges, which were common in that period, leading governments to invest in their development. In contrast, China faced threats from highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons were ineffective. As a result, China focused on improving horse archer units, which were more effective against their primary adversaries.\n\nGiven this information, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.\n- The passage does not mention Confucian traditionalism as a factor in the development of gunpowder weaponry.\n\nB. They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.\n- The passage does not suggest that China relied on numerical strength; rather, it focused on the effectiveness of horse archers against their specific enemies.\n\nC. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\n- This option aligns with the passage, which states that China focused on improving horse archer units because they were more effective against the highly mobile steppe nomads.\n\nD. They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.\n- The passage does not mention financial constraints as a reason for China's focus on horse archers.\n\nBased on the passage, the most accurate reason is:\n\nC. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs."}

Tacitus describes the conflict among the tribes with a sense of satisfaction, noting that the Romans were pleased to witness the tribes fighting each other rather than uniting against Rome. This sentiment reflects a strategic preference for discord among Rome's enemies, which would prevent them from posing a unified threat to the Roman Empire.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Disgust for barbarian peoples: While the excerpt does show a lack of respect for the Germanic tribes, it does not explicitly convey disgust. The focus is more on the strategic advantage Rome gains from their infighting.\n\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks: The excerpt does not express concern about attacks; rather, it shows a sense of relief and satisfaction that the tribes are fighting each other instead of attacking Rome.\n\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy: This option is not directly relevant to the content of the excerpt. The passage does not provide information about the philosophical inclinations of the Roman aristocracy.\n\nD. Maintenance of large armies: The passage does not discuss the size or maintenance of Roman armies. It focuses on the internal conflicts of the Germanic tribes and the Roman reaction to it.\n\nGiven the content of the excerpt, the views expressed are best seen as evidence of:\n\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks\n\nThe Romans are pleased with the discord among the tribes because it reduces the threat of a unified barbarian attack against Rome. This strategic concern is the primary focus of the passage."}

This immigration wave was largely driven by the demand for labor in several key industries.\n\n1. **Railroad Construction**: The construction of the Transcontinental Railroad in the 1860s was a major factor in Chinese immigration. Chinese laborers were heavily recruited to work on the Central Pacific Railroad, which was part of the Transcontinental Railroad project. Their labor was crucial in completing this monumental infrastructure project.\n\n2. **Fertilizer Harvesting**: This was not a significant industry driving Chinese immigration during this period.\n\n3. **Sugarcane Production**: While Chinese laborers did work in sugarcane fields, particularly in Hawaii, this was not the primary driver of Chinese immigration to the mainland United States.\n\n4. **Gold Mining**: The California Gold Rush of 1849 also attracted a significant number of Chinese immigrants. Many Chinese laborers came to California in search of fortune and worked in the gold mines.\n\nGiven these considerations, the two most significant economic activities that drove Chinese immigration were railroad construction and gold mining. However, the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad had a more direct and substantial impact on the influx of Chinese laborers, leading to increased tensions and ultimately the enactment of the Chinese Exclusion Act.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\nA.

At this time, there was a significant conflict between the Catholic Church (spiritual power) and secular rulers (temporal power). Luther was challenging the authority of the Pope and the Catholic Church, advocating for reforms and criticizing the Church's overreach into secular matters.\n\n2. **Textual Analysis**:\n   - Luther mentions that the Romanists (Catholic Church authorities) have claimed that \"the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them\" and that \"the spiritual power is above the temporal.\" This indicates a distinction between two types of authority: one related to the Church (spiritual) and one related to secular governance (temporal).\n   - The term \"temporal power\" is contrasted with \"spiritual power,\" suggesting that \"temporal power\" refers to non-religious, secular authority.\n\n3. **Options Analysis**:\n   - **A. A clerical or ecclesiastical authority**: This would be the \"spiritual power,\" not the \"temporal power.\"\n   - **B. A legal or scholarly authority**: While legal authority could be part of temporal power, it is not the primary context here.

When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe authors of both passages served institutions associated with which of the following colonial techniques commonly used by Western imperial powers?", "choices": ["Direct rule by the crown", "Complete privatization of colonial authority", "Martial law enforced by sizable armies", "The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits"], "answer": 3, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the context and content of the passages provided and understand the colonial techniques they reference.\n\n1. **William Bentinck's Passage (1829)**:\n   - Bentinck was the Governor-General of India, a position under the British Crown.\n   - His discussion revolves around the practice of sati and the broader implications for British rule in India.\n   - The British East India Company played a significant role in the administration of India during this period, operating under a royal charter.\n\n2. **George Simpson's Passage (1826)**:\n   - Simpson was the head of the Northern Department of the Hudson's Bay Company.\n   - He discusses the control and subordination of the Indians who trade with the company.\n   - The Hudson's Bay Company was a chartered company, granted rights by the British Crown to trade and govern in certain territories.\n\nGiven this information, we can evaluate the options:\n\nA. **Direct rule by the crown**:\n   - This implies direct administration by the British government, which does not fully align with the context of the East India Company or the Hudson's Bay Company, both of which operated under charters.\n\nB. **Complete privatization of colonial authority**:\n   - This suggests total private control without any government oversight, which is not accurate for either the East India Company or the Hudson's Bay Company, as both had significant government involvement and oversight.\n\nC. **Martial law enforced by sizable armies**:\n   - While military force was certainly a component of colonial rule, the passages do not specifically emphasize martial law or large armies as the primary method of control.\n\nD. **The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits**:\n   - This accurately describes the method used by Western imperial powers in both cases. The British East India Company and the Hudson's Bay Company were both chartered companies that assumed the costs of administration and shared profits with the Crown.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits"}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n—Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

The passage indicates that Bonesteel was concerned about Soviet actions and was trying to establish a surrender zone that would be acceptable to the Soviets while preventing them from taking over all of Korea. This implies a level of cooperation but also significant wariness.\n\n2. **Comrades-in-arms**: This option implies a close and cooperative relationship, working together towards a common goal with mutual trust. The passage does not support this level of camaraderie, as it highlights the strategic maneuvering and concern over Soviet intentions.\n\n3. **Mortal enemies**: This option suggests a relationship characterized by open hostility and direct conflict. While there is clear tension and strategic opposition, the passage does not describe direct conflict or enmity at the level of mortal enemies.\n\n4. **Distant strangers**: This option implies a lack of significant interaction or concern for each other. The passage clearly shows that the United States was very concerned about Soviet actions and was actively planning to counter them, indicating a more involved relationship than that of distant strangers.\n\nGiven the strategic considerations and the cautious approach described in the passage, the best description of the relationship between the United States and the Soviets is:\n\n**A.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year….\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya. Selected, translated, and annotated by David Frye. Copyright 2006 Hackett Publishing Company.

The key points highlighted in the passage include:\n\n1. **Harsh Treatment and Exploitation**: The Indians are subjected to severe punishment, torture, and death in the mines. They are forced to work without proper compensation and are made to perform additional tasks unrelated to mining, such as herding cattle and conveying goods.\n\n2. **Corruption and Lack of Oversight**: The mine owners, regardless of their ethnic background (Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians), are described as tyrannical and unaccountable due to the lack of regular audits and inspections. There is also mention of widespread bribery and collusion among officials and mine owners, which prevents any effective remedy for the abuses.\n\n3. **Economic Exploitation**: The Indians are forced to accept goods like corn, meat, and chicha at their own expense, which are then deducted from their wages, leading to deep debt and poverty. This economic exploitation makes it impossible for them to pay their tribute.\n\n4. **Social and Moral Corruption**: The passage also mentions the use of Indian women as concubines under the pretext of cooking, indicating a moral and social degradation imposed by the mine owners.\n\nGiven these points, the passage does not support the idea of the formal adoption of debt slavery (Option A) as it does not mention any legal or formal system of debt slavery. It also clearly contradicts the notion of the absence of corruption among elites (Option B) by highlighting the widespread corruption and collusion. While the passage does criticize the ineffective protection of Native Americans, it does not directly address the king's interest or lack thereof in their welfare (Option C).\n\nThe most fitting interpretation is that the passage provides evidence for the imposition of social stratification based on the origin of birth (Option D). The Native Americans are subjected to severe exploitation and abuse, while the mine owners and colonial officials, who are of different ethnic backgrounds, collude to maintain their power and control. This indicates a clear social hierarchy and stratification based on birth and ethnicity.\n\n**Final Verdict: D. The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth**"}

However, the passage does not mention educational standards or the need for educated immigrants. The focus is on the ability to write in a European language, which does not necessarily correlate with high educational standards.\n\nB. **A tactic allowing the exclusion of non-Europeans without referring directly to race.**\n   - This option suggests that the language requirement is a way to exclude non-Europeans indirectly. Given that the requirement is to write in a European language, it would disproportionately affect non-Europeans who are less likely to be proficient in a European language. This interpretation aligns with the historical context of the time, where many immigration policies were designed to favor European immigrants.\n\nC. **A measure to ensure that all immigrants possessed useful expertise.**\n   - This option implies that the language requirement is about ensuring immigrants have useful skills. However, the ability to write in a European language does not necessarily indicate useful expertise or skills relevant to the labor market.\n\nD. **An attempt to bar all immigrants regardless of origin.**\n   - This option suggests that the language requirement is a blanket measure to exclude all immigrants. However, the specific mention of a European language indicates that the policy is not aimed at excluding all immigrants but rather those who do not meet this particular language criterion.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate interpretation is:\n\nB. **a tactic allowing the exclusion of non-Europeans without referring directly to race.**\n\nThis option best captures the intent behind the language requirement, which is to indirectly exclude non-European immigrants by imposing a language test that they are less likely to pass."}

The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or \"Sea of Precious Virtues,\" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.\nRobert Irwin, \"Islam and the Crusades,\" 1995\nIt is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.\nIbn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185\nThese two passages are best understood in the context of which of the following?", "choices": ["The influence of religion on interaction between cultures", "The use of religion to justify armed violence", "The syncretic fusion of different religious traditions", "The attempt of a religious group to proselytize to those following another faith"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To determine the best context for understanding the two passages, let's analyze each one in detail.\n\n1. The first passage by Robert Irwin discusses the concept of jihad in the Middle Ages. It highlights the belief among some Muslim authorities that jihad was an ongoing obligation until the entire world was under Islamic rule. It also mentions that a Muslim ruler's primary duty was to prosecute jihad and that failing to do so was seen as corrupting the world.\n\n2. The second passage by Ibn Jubayr describes the interactions between Christians and Muslims around Mount Lebanon. It notes that Christians treated Muslim hermits kindly and shared food with them, recognizing their dedication to God. Additionally, it mentions that Christian merchants were not hindered in Muslim territories.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The influence of religion on interaction between cultures: This option is relevant because both passages discuss how religious beliefs influence interactions between Muslims and Christians. The first passage shows the influence of religious duty on political actions, while the second passage highlights peaceful and respectful interactions based on religious recognition.\n\nB. The use of religion to justify armed violence: This option is relevant to the first passage, which discusses the obligation of jihad and the prosecution of war. However, it does not fully encompass the second passage, which focuses on peaceful interactions.\n\nC. The syncretic fusion of different religious traditions: This option is not relevant because neither passage discusses the blending or fusion of religious traditions.\n\nD. The attempt of a religious group to proselytize to those following another faith: This option is not relevant because neither passage discusses efforts to convert people from one religion to another.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best context for understanding both passages is:\n\nA. The influence of religion on interaction between cultures\n\nThis option captures the essence of both passages, highlighting how religious beliefs shape interactions, whether through conflict or peaceful coexistence."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?", "choices": ["The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India", "British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company", "Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority", "The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government"], "answer": 3, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "To determine the correct outcome of the events discussed in both passages, we need to consider the historical context of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny or the First War of Indian Independence.\n\n1. **Passage Analysis**:\n   - **William Howard Russell's Passage**: This passage describes the Cawnpore massacres, emphasizing the shock and horror of British people being killed by Indians. It highlights the racial and religious dimensions of the conflict and the desire of the Indian rebels to overthrow British rule.\n   - **Rudrangshu Mukherjee's Passage**: This passage discusses the broader implications of the revolt, focusing on the challenge to the British monopoly on violence and the racial hierarchy that underpinned British rule in India.\n\n2. **Historical Context**:\n   - The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major, but ultimately unsuccessful, uprising against the British East India Company's rule. The rebellion led to significant changes in how India was governed.\n   - In the aftermath of the rebellion, the British government took direct control of India from the British East India Company. This marked the end of the Company's rule and the beginning of the British Raj, where India was governed directly by the British Crown.\n\n3. **Outcome Analysis**:\n   - **Option A**: The expulsion of the British East India Company did occur, but partial home rule for India did not happen immediately after the rebellion.\n   - **Option B**: The British East India Company did not strengthen; instead, it was dissolved.\n   - **Option C**: Indian military success and full independence did not occur as a result of the rebellion.\n   - **Option D**: The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government is accurate. The British government took over the administration of India from the British East India Company, leading to the establishment of the British Raj.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government**."}

These regulations included registering their names upon entry and exit, not being allowed to stay overnight in the city, and facing imprisonment if they overstayed their permitted time. This detailed account of the procedures indicates a highly controlled and regulated approach to foreign trade.\n\nLet's analyze each option in light of this information:\n\nA. The Ming Dynasty was very supportive of and welcoming to all commercial enterprise.\n- This option is not supported by the passage. The strict regulations and limitations on the traders' movements suggest that the Ming Dynasty was not particularly welcoming or supportive of all commercial enterprises.\n\nB. The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.\n- This option is supported by the passage. The detailed procedures for entering and exiting the city, the prohibition on staying overnight, and the threat of imprisonment for overstaying all indicate a desire to strictly regulate trade and limit contact with foreigners. These measures could also facilitate the collection of taxes by keeping close track of traders.\n\nC. The Ming Dynasty was too busy battling pirates along its coast to pay any attention to regular merchant activity.\n- This option is not supported by the passage. The detailed regulations described indicate that the Ming Dynasty was paying close attention to merchant activity, rather than being too preoccupied with other issues.\n\nD. The Ming Dynasty only allowed Portugal to trade with China through Canton, permitting only one boat a year.\n- This option is not supported by the passage. While the passage does describe the Portuguese trading in Canton, it does not specify that only one boat per year was allowed or that Canton was the only port for Portuguese trade.\n\nGiven the evidence in the passage, the most supported inference about the trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty is:\n\nB. The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

British support for growing resistance movements in Eastern Europe: While Britain did support resistance movements in Eastern Europe, this was not the primary focus of Churchill's speech. The speech is more about Britain's own resolve to fight.\n\nB. British trade deals with American manufacturers of military hardware: This option is not relevant to the speech. Churchill's speech is about military resistance and determination, not about trade deals.\n\nC. British appeasement of the Axis powers: By June 1940, British policy had shifted away from appeasement. Churchill's speech is a clear rejection of appeasement and a call to arms against the Axis powers.\n\nD.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nEvery two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von Füch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nAccording to the second passage, which of the following contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?", "choices": ["Interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries", "Native inexperience in hunting deep into the subarctic tundra", "Competition from Russian hunters and trappers", "Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals"], "answer": 3, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "To determine which factor contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations, we need to closely examine the second passage by Heinrich von Füch.\n\nThe passage states:\n- The natives have been forced to pay yasak tribute in sables, red foxes, or cash.\n- Initially, there were plenty of furbearing animals, but now there are no sables and not many foxes left.\n- The depletion of these animals extends from the shores of the Arctic Ocean to the Lena River.\n- Almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the primary issue is the depletion of furbearing animals, which makes it difficult for the natives to meet their tribute obligations.

This philosophy emphasized peaceful resistance and civil disobedience as means to bring about change. Gandhi's methods were particularly influential in movements that sought to achieve their aims through nonviolent means.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The Zionist movement that created the modern state of Israel:\n- The Zionist movement was primarily focused on establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine. While it involved various strategies, including political lobbying and settlement, it also included violent confrontations and conflicts, particularly in the later stages leading up to the establishment of Israel in 1948. Nonviolence was not a defining characteristic of this movement.\n\nB. The independence movements that freed the states of southeast Asia from colonial rule:\n- While some independence movements in Southeast Asia were influenced by Gandhi's ideas, many of them involved significant armed struggle and violent resistance against colonial powers. Examples include the Vietnamese struggle against French colonial rule and the Indonesian fight against Dutch colonialism. Nonviolence was not the predominant strategy in these movements.\n\nC. The civil rights movements that changed the legal status of minorities in the United States:\n- The American civil rights movement, particularly under the leadership of figures like Martin Luther King Jr., was heavily influenced by Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence.

The movement employed nonviolent protests, sit-ins, and marches to challenge segregation and discrimination, leading to significant legal and social changes in the United States.\n\nD. The communist movement that changed the government of Cuba:\n- The Cuban Revolution, led by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, was characterized by armed struggle and guerrilla warfare against the Batista regime.

Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent.

Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.\n- This option is not entirely accurate. While New World crops such as maize and cassava did eventually become important in Africa, their introduction and widespread adoption occurred later and were not the primary reason for trading contacts with Europeans during this period.\n\nB. Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.\n- This option is plausible. The introduction of firearms through trade with Europeans did play a significant role in the power dynamics within Sub-Saharan Africa. African leaders and states often sought firearms to strengthen their military capabilities, which in turn helped them to consolidate power and expand their territories.\n\nC. Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.\n- This option is partially correct but not entirely comprehensive. While the transatlantic slave trade was a significant aspect of trade between Sub-Saharan Africans and Europeans, it was not the sole reason for the importance of trading contacts. Additionally, African societies had their own internal slave systems and traded slaves with other regions, including the Arab world.\n\nD. Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.\n- This option is less accurate. While there were conflicts involving Muslim and Arab traders, the primary interactions with Europeans were not centered around evicting these groups. Instead, the focus was more on trade, including the exchange of goods and slaves.\n\nGiven the historical context, the best explanation for the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. is:\n\nB. Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.\n\nThis option accurately reflects the significant impact of European trade, particularly the acquisition of firearms, on the political and military landscape of Sub-Saharan Africa during this period."}

However, the rural peasantry often had less access to educational resources compared to urban populations.\n\n2. **Members of the Russian Orthodox clergy (B)**: The clergy traditionally had higher literacy rates compared to the general population because religious duties required reading and writing skills.

However, historical records indicate that the Mongols were generally tolerant of various religions in their domains, including in Russia. Therefore, this option is not accurate.\n\nB. \"relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while the Mongol administration in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state\"\n- This option highlights a key difference: the Mongols in Russia did rely heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, whereas in China, they adopted and emulated the centralized bureaucratic state of the Chinese. This is a well-documented difference between the two regions under Mongol rule.\n\nC. \"was viewed favorably by its subjects, while the Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\"\n- This option is not accurate because the Mongol rule in Russia was generally not viewed favorably by its subjects, who often resented the heavy tribute and control. Additionally, while there were periods of unrest in China, the Mongol administration did manage to maintain control for a significant period.\n\nD. \"stimulated Russian export of trade goods to China, while the Mongol administration in China intentionally curtailed Chinese economic activity\"\n- This option is not accurate because the Mongol rule in China did not intentionally curtail Chinese economic activity.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties.

A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.

British sale of opium in China\n- This option directly aligns with the historical context of the Opium Wars, where Britain was exporting opium to China, leading to widespread addiction and social issues. The passage's reference to a \"poisonous drug\" and the criticism of the foreigners' profit motives strongly suggest opium.\n\nB. British exports of tobacco to China\n- While tobacco is harmful, the historical context and the severity of the language used in the passage are more consistent with the opium trade rather than tobacco.\n\nC.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road.

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

The speech calls for Christians to take up arms and reclaim Jerusalem and other holy lands from Muslim control, which is a direct reference to the initiation of the First Crusade. The Crusades were a series of religious wars sanctioned by the Latin Church in the medieval period, primarily aimed at recovering the Holy Land from Muslim rule.\n\n- The Mongol invasions of the Middle East (A) occurred later, in the 13th century, and are not related to the context of this speech.\n- The Protestant Reformation (B) began in the 16th century, long after the time of Pope Urban II and the First Crusade.\n- The Age of Discovery (C) refers to the period of European exploration and colonization that began in the 15th century, which is also not relevant to the context of this speech.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The Crusades"}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"I travelled thence to 'Aden, the port of Yemen, on the coast of the ocean. It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325–1354 C.E.\nWhich of the following led directly to the development of the economic system described in the journal?", "choices": ["Military campaigns", "Meteorological phenomena", "Competition with European trade networks", "The presence of highly developed port cities"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "To determine which factor led directly to the development of the economic system described in Ibn Battuta's journal, we need to analyze the context provided in the passage.\n\nThe passage describes Aden as a significant port city with a bustling trade network involving merchants from India and Egypt. It highlights the wealth of the merchants, the presence of large vessels, and the city's role as a hub for Indian and Malabar ports. The economic system is characterized by trade, wealth accumulation, and the presence of merchants, porters, and fishermen.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Military campaigns**: The passage does not mention any military activities or conquests that directly influenced the economic system of Aden. The focus is on trade and commerce rather than military actions.\n\nB. **Meteorological phenomena**: While the passage mentions the hot climate and the reliance on rainwater reservoirs, these factors do not directly explain the development of the economic system based on trade and merchant activities.\n\nC. **Competition with European trade networks**: The passage does not reference any competition with European trade networks. The described trade involves Indian and Egyptian merchants, indicating that the economic system developed independently of European influence.\n\nD. **The presence of highly developed port cities**: This option aligns well with the passage. Aden is described as a port city with significant trade activities, large vessels, and wealthy merchants. The presence of such a developed port city would naturally lead to the economic system based on trade and commerce described in the journal.\n\nGiven the context and details provided in the passage, the most accurate answer is:\n\nD. The presence of highly developed port cities"}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIs it not unity alone that can weld us into an effective force, capable of creating our own progress and making our valuable contribution to world peace? Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule.

He emphasizes the need for a collective effort and common purpose among African nations, suggesting that political independence alone is insufficient to overcome the legacy of colonialism. Instead, he calls for a union rooted in common planning and endeavor.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. **Nationalism**: This typically refers to the advocacy for the interests of a particular nation, often in opposition to foreign control or influence. While the speaker does discuss national development, his primary focus is on unity among multiple African states rather than the interests of a single nation.\n\nB. **Socialism**: This is a political and economic theory advocating for collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods. The passage does not specifically address economic systems or the ownership of resources in this manner.\n\nC. **Pan-Africanism**: This is the principle or advocacy of the political union of all the indigenous inhabitants of Africa. The speaker's emphasis on unity, common purpose, and collective effort among African states aligns closely with the ideals of Pan-Africanism.\n\nD. **Neocolonialism**: This term refers to the practice of using capitalism, globalization, and cultural forces to control a country in lieu of direct military or political control. The speaker is actually arguing against the lingering effects of colonialism and advocating for unity to overcome these effects, which is contrary to the concept of neocolonialism.\n\nGiven the context and the speaker's emphasis on unity and collective effort among African states, the cause being espoused is most accurately described as:\n\nC. **Pan-Africanism**"}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Persians, an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation forsooth which has not directed its heart and has not entrusted its spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and fire; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion….The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months.

The city remained under Byzantine control until it was captured by the Fourth Crusade in 1204 and later by the Ottoman Turks in 1453. Therefore, this option is not relevant to the context of the speech.\n\n2. **The invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks (Option B)**:\n   - The Seljuk Turks, a Muslim dynasty, invaded Anatolia and defeated the Byzantine Empire at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. This event significantly weakened Byzantine control over the region and posed a direct threat to Constantinople. This invasion is a plausible inspiration for Urban's call to aid Constantinople.\n\n3. **The invasion of the Balkans by the Avars and Bulgars (Option C)**:\n   - The Avars and Bulgars invaded the Balkans much earlier, during the early medieval period (6th to 9th centuries). These invasions were not contemporary with Pope Urban II's speech in 1095 and thus are unlikely to be the direct inspiration for his invocation of Constantinople.\n\n4. **The conversion of the people of Constantinople to Catholic Christianity (Option D)**:\n   - The people of Constantinople were primarily Eastern Orthodox Christians, not Catholics. The Great Schism of 1054 had already divided the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches. This option does not align with the context of the speech, which focuses on military and territorial threats rather than religious conversion.\n\nGiven the historical context and the details in the speech, the most direct inspiration for Urban's invocation of Constantinople is the invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks. This event posed a significant threat to the Byzantine Empire and Constantinople, prompting the Byzantine Emperor to seek assistance from the West.\n\n**Final Verdict: B. The invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks**"}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBy what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nOn which of the following arguments does the author of the passage principally base his appeal?", "choices": ["It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.", "Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral.", "Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade.", "Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "The passage provided is a letter from Lin Zexu, a Chinese trade commissioner, to Queen Victoria in 1839. In the letter, Lin Zexu argues against the British trade of opium to China. To determine the principal argument on which the author bases his appeal, we need to closely examine the content and reasoning presented in the passage.\n\n1. **Hypocrisy Argument**: Lin Zexu points out that opium is strictly prohibited in Britain due to its harmful effects, yet the British are exporting it to China. He emphasizes the inconsistency and moral contradiction in this practice, suggesting that it is hypocritical to sell a harmful substance to another country while banning it in one's own.\n\n2. **Confucian Teachings**: The passage does not mention Confucian teachings or any specific moral or religious doctrines that forbid the use of narcotics. Therefore, this argument is not present in the text.\n\n3. **Unfavorable Balance of Trade**: While the passage does discuss the negative impact of opium on China, it does not specifically mention an unfavorable balance of trade as the primary concern. The focus is more on the moral and health implications rather than economic trade balances.\n\n4. **Military Power**: The passage does not make any reference to the relative military power of Britain and China or suggest that Britain should fear military retaliation from China.\n\nGiven these points, the principal argument Lin Zexu uses in his appeal is the hypocrisy of the British in selling a harmful substance to China while prohibiting it in their own country. This is clearly articulated in the passage when he states, \"We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nI have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . .
