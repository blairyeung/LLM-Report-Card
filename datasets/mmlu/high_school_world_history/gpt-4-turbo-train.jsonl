This trade pattern was heavily reliant on the availability of precious metals (like silver) and the demand for luxury goods.\n\nTo determine which development from the period 1750–1900 C.E. most directly undid these trade patterns, we need to consider how each option would impact the nature of trade and economic interactions described:\n\nA. The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants could potentially alter trade patterns by introducing new goods into the market. However, this option does not necessarily undo the existing trade patterns but rather diversifies or expands them.\n\nB. Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas primarily influenced political and philosophical thought and led to changes in governance. While these revolutions could indirectly affect trade by altering political structures and economic policies, they do not directly address the trade mechanisms or the commodities involved in the trade described.\n\nC. The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, fundamentally transformed economies from agrarian-based to industrial-based. This revolution led to the mass production of goods, including those that could replace traditionally traded items. More critically, it led to advancements in mining and metallurgy, which increased the availability of precious metals and other resources. This could reduce the reliance on specific trade routes and patterns, such as those dependent on the silver trade from Japan.\n\nD. The colonization of Africa involved the extraction of various resources, including precious metals and raw materials. However, like option A, this would more likely diversify and expand European economic interests rather than directly undoing the specific trade patterns between Macao, Japan, and India.\n\nAmong these options, the Industrial Revolution (C) is the most plausible answer. It directly impacted the economic foundation of the trade patterns described by increasing the production capabilities and resource availability in Europe, thereby reducing European dependency on Asian markets for certain goods and precious metals. This shift would undermine the specific trade dynamics involving the exchange of silver from Japan for Chinese goods, as Europeans could increasingly produce or obtain similar goods and resources domestically or from other colonies."}

Nkrumah advocates for a political union of African states, which he believes will project the African personality more effectively and command greater respect internationally.\n\nThis argument aligns with the ideology of Pan-Africanism, which promotes the idea of solidarity and unity among all African states and people, both on the continent and in the diaspora. Pan-Africanism seeks to strengthen bonds of solidarity between all indigenous and diaspora ethnic groups of African descent and advocates for a collective self-reliance to achieve better economic, social, and political conditions in Africa.\n\nThe other options provided do not align as closely with Nkrumah's argument:\n- Communism focuses on class struggle and the establishment of a classless society, which is not the central theme of Nkrumah's argument.\n- African socialism relates to incorporating African values and community practices into socialist ideologies, which, while possibly related, is not explicitly mentioned in the passage.\n- Neocolonialism refers to the control of less-developed countries by developed countries through indirect means, such as economic and political pressures, which is a condition Nkrumah is arguing against rather than supporting.\n\nTherefore, the ideology that Nkrumah's argument most clearly supports is:\nA.

The text emphasizes domestic duties, moral conduct, and the importance of serving the husband and maintaining ancestral worship. This reflects a broader trend during the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., where women's roles were largely confined to the household and their activities were centered around family and domestic responsibilities.\n\nBefore the advent of sedentary societies, in many hunter-gatherer communities, gender roles were more fluid, and women often participated more directly in gathering and sometimes hunting, which were crucial for the community's survival. This involvement allowed women a certain degree of autonomy and importance in both the private and public spheres of their communities.\n\nAs societies transitioned to agriculture and became more sedentary, social structures became more complex and hierarchical. Property ownership and inheritance practices often favored males, leading to patriarchal family structures. In these structures, women's roles became more confined to the private sphere, focusing on child-rearing, managing the household, and supporting their husbands or male relatives. Public decision-making roles and community leadership were increasingly reserved for men, reducing the direct influence women had outside the home.\n\nGiven this context, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC. Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere.\n\nThis choice accurately reflects the shift from relatively balanced gender roles in many pre-agricultural societies to more restricted roles centered around domestic responsibilities in the private sphere during the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E."}

This suggests that the ruler valued Sanehat's abilities and achievements, leading to his high appointment, which could be seen as meritocratic. However, the text does not explicitly discuss bureaucratic appointments but rather military leadership and personal valor.\n\nOption B, \"Long-distance contact between Egypt and other lands,\" is supported by the text as it describes military campaigns and interactions between different lands, indicating that there was contact between Egypt and other regions. However, the primary focus of the passage is not on the contact itself but on the military aspects and personal achievements of Sanehat.\n\nOption C, \"The clan as the basic political unit,\" is not directly supported by the text.

A widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I.\n\nAdolf Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles in Source 1 reflects a broader sentiment that was prevalent in Germany after World War I. Many Germans felt that the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I, was excessively punitive. The treaty imposed heavy reparations, territorial losses, and strict limitations on the German military. Hitler's speech to the Reichstag on September 1, 1939, expresses these sentiments by describing the treaty as a \"Diktat\" and claiming that Germany was coerced into signing it under dire threats. This perspective fueled nationalist sentiments and was a significant factor in Hitler's rise to power, as he capitalized on these feelings of injustice and national humiliation to gain support. Thus, the historical background for Hitler's condemnation is rooted in the widespread belief among Germans that the Treaty of Versailles was unjust and imposed unfairly harsh conditions on Germany."}

They traded goods such as white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain for silver in Japan, which they then used in China to purchase more goods. This trade was highly profitable and centered around the exchange of precious metals and luxury goods.\n\nTo determine which development most directly undid these trade patterns, we need to consider how each option affected the flow of silver and the economic interactions in the region:\n\nA. The eastward expansion of Russia during this period primarily involved Siberia and did not directly impact the maritime trade routes used by the Portuguese in East Asia.\n\nB. The Portuguese conquest of India (Goa in 1510) allowed the Portuguese to control key ports and bolster their maritime capabilities in the Indian Ocean. However, this conquest actually facilitated their trade in Asia rather than undoing it, as it secured their trade routes and enhanced their ability to trade between India, China, and Japan.\n\nC. The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1603 led to a period of isolationist policies in Japan, known as Sakoku, which began in the 1630s. These policies severely restricted foreign trade and limited it to specific ports under strict control. This would have directly impacted the Portuguese trade with Japan, particularly their ability to trade for silver, as described in the passage.\n\nD. The Spanish conquest of Mexico (beginning with the fall of the Aztec Empire in 1521) led to the influx of American silver into the global market, particularly through trade from the Americas to Spain and onward to other European markets. While this increased the global supply of silver, it did not directly disrupt the Portuguese trade routes between Macao, China, and Japan.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most direct impact on the trade patterns described would be option C, the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

Sukarno's call to mobilize the collective strength of Asia and Africa for peace resonates with the movement's objectives of maintaining independence in international affairs and promoting peace.\n\nOption B, \"Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation,\" while related to peace, is not directly addressed in the passage. The focus of Sukarno's address is more on general peace and political solidarity rather than specific disarmament.\n\nOption C, \"The Green Revolution in agriculture,\" is unrelated to the themes discussed in the passage. The Green Revolution refers to the increase in agricultural production resulting from the introduction of high-yield varieties of staples and improved agricultural techniques.\n\nOption D, \"Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology,\" might seem relevant but is too narrow in scope. Sukarno's speech addresses both Asia and Africa, advocating for a broader coalition beyond just pan-Asian interests.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is A, \"The formation of the non-aligned movement,\" as it directly relates to the historical context and themes of Sukarno's address at the Bandung Conference."}

Leave it aside in order that ye may succeed.\nthe Qur'an, Sura 5: 89\nWhen once you hear the roses are in bloom,\nThen is the time, my love, to pour the wine.\nthe Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám\nA comparison of both verses would best support which of the following conclusions?", "choices": ["Many Muslims inclined toward atheism in the premodern era.", "Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims.", "Christian missionaries were steadily winning converts among Muslim populations.", "Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice."], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To determine which conclusion is best supported by the comparison of the two verses, we need to analyze the content and context of each.\n\nThe first verse from the Qur'an explicitly condemns strong drink (alcohol), games of chance, and idols as \"an infamy of Satan's handiwork\" and advises believers to avoid these to succeed. This reflects a clear religious directive within Islam against the consumption of alcohol and engaging in gambling.\n\nThe second verse from the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, a work by a Persian poet, mathematician, and philosopher, presents a contrasting view. It romanticizes the act of drinking wine, especially at a joyful time such as when \"the roses are in bloom.\" This suggests a celebration of life's pleasures, including those forbidden by strict Islamic teachings.\n\nComparing these verses, we see a divergence in views regarding the consumption of alcohol:\n\n- Option A, suggesting that many Muslims inclined toward atheism in the premodern era, is too broad and unsupported by the verses alone. The verses do not discuss atheism or a rejection of God.\n- Option B, stating that religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims, is supported by the contrast between the strict prohibition in the Qur'an and the celebratory tone of the Rubáiyát. This indicates that not all individuals who identified culturally or religiously with Islam followed its strictest interpretations.\n- Option C, about Christian missionaries winning converts, is unrelated to the content of the verses.\n- Option D, suggesting that Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice, is also too broad and unsupported by the verses. The Rubáiyát does not express hostility to religion but rather a different perspective on life's pleasures.\n\nTherefore, the best conclusion supported by the comparison of the verses is:\nB. Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims. This conclusion acknowledges the diversity of practice and belief within the historical and cultural contexts of Islam, as illustrated by the differing attitudes towards alcohol in the texts."}

The Australian act includes provisions such as a language test that could effectively limit immigration from non-European countries, and specific exclusions for manual laborers unless they possess special skills deemed necessary by the Minister. Similarly, the U.S. act directly targets Chinese laborers, prohibiting their immigration and setting penalties for those who assist in their migration.\n\nThese acts do not primarily concern trade protectionism, which would involve policies designed to protect domestic industries from foreign competition through tariffs and other trade barriers. Nor do they reflect a desire to attract skilled labor from abroad, as they are more about exclusion than recruitment. While there could be elements of attracting skilled labor, the overarching theme is not about attraction but restriction.\n\nThe acts also do not specifically target Jewish people or promote anti-Semitic ideologies, which would be characterized by discrimination against Jewish individuals specifically.\n\nInstead, both acts are indicative of a broader trend of hardening anti-immigrant sentiment during the time. This trend involved the development of laws and policies that were designed to restrict the immigration of certain racial or ethnic groups, often justified by economic concerns, cultural preservation, or public safety. These sentiments were part of a larger pattern of nativism, where native-born populations sought to protect their interests against those of immigrants.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": ["Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown", "Killing of civilians during wartime", "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction", "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "The passages provided discuss the violence during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, particularly focusing on the Cawnpore massacres. The first passage by William Howard Russell describes the violence as a result of a revolt by a subject race against their colonial masters, involving elements of servile war, religious war, race war, and nationalistic motivations. It emphasizes the shock and horror from the perspective of the British due to the rebellion of their subjects and the targeted killing of white men, women, and children.\n\nThe second passage by Rudrangshu Mukherjee contextualizes the violence within the broader framework of British colonial rule in India, highlighting the systematic monopoly of violence maintained by the British and how the revolt challenged this monopoly. Mukherjee points out that the British constructed their dominance through racial hierarchies and dehumanization of Indians, which in turn justified their exclusive right to use violence.\n\nBoth passages describe a scenario where violence is not random or incidental but is a direct consequence of the colonial context and the power dynamics between the colonizers and the colonized. This violence is not merely collateral damage or banditry but is deeply intertwined with the identities and the political objectives of the involved parties.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best answer is:\n\nB. Killing of civilians during wartime.\n\nThis option directly addresses the nature of the violence described in the passages, where civilians were targeted during a period of armed conflict (the Indian Rebellion of 1857), reflecting the intense and brutal nature of the conflict between the British colonial forces and the Indian rebels. This form of violence is distinct from the other options as it specifically involves the intentional targeting of civilians within the context of a war, driven by the dynamics of colonial power and resistance."}

The text explicitly mentions that they are Muslims who are committed to performing prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and memorizing the Qur'an. These activities are central to the practice of Islam, demonstrating a serious adherence to the faith.\n\nOption B, \"They study Islamic law faithfully,\" directly reflects this commitment. The study of fiqh involves understanding and applying the laws of Islam based on the Qur'an and Hadith, which is a critical aspect of practicing Islam devoutly.\n\nThe other options, while they describe cultural practices and social norms, do not directly relate to the religious seriousness of the Malians. For instance, deriving genealogy from the maternal side (Option A) and not yielding to sexual jealousy (Option C) are more indicative of unique cultural practices rather than direct evidence of religious commitment.

In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . .

Silk is historically known to have originated from China, and its presence in Ghana suggests trade relations with Asia, specifically through the Silk Road which connected China to various parts of the world, including Africa. The use of silk in Ghana indicates not only the wealth and status of those who wore it but also implies a trade network that would have facilitated the import of silk from Asia to Africa.\n\nOptions A, B, and C, while they mention aspects that could be linked to foreign influences (such as horses potentially from the Mongols, the kow-tow which is a form of bowing deeply used in Chinese culture, and adornment with gold and jewels possibly from India), do not directly indicate trade with Asia as clearly as the use of silk. The passage does not explicitly state that the horses came from the Mongols, nor does it confirm that the kow-tow was practiced or that the jewels were from India. These connections are more speculative without additional supporting evidence in the text.\n\nTherefore, the most direct evidence in the passage that Ghanaians were engaged in trade with Asia is the presence of silk robes, as stated in option D. This indicates a direct or indirect trade relationship with Asia, where silk was a primary commodity."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels.

Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment?", "choices": ["The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations", "The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market", "The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company", "The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To determine which option best supports Walter Rodney's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment, we need to focus on examples that illustrate how Western European actions directly impacted African economic conditions negatively, aligning with the exploitation and extraction themes Rodney discusses.\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations - This option directly implicates Western European capitalists in the exploitation of African resources (human resources, in this case). The slave trade was a major economic activity driven by Western Europeans (including the British, Portuguese, French, and Spanish) that resulted in significant wealth for European economies at the expense of African societies. This led to a massive depletion of African populations and a disruption of African economic and social systems, which aligns with Rodney's argument about the draining of African wealth and hindering the continent's development.\n\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market - While this option does involve exploitation of Africans, it specifically mentions Arabian merchants rather than Western European capitalists. Thus, it does not directly support Rodney's assertion about Western European responsibility.\n\nC. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company - This option does involve Western European capitalists (the Dutch East India Company) and represents a form of colonial expansion in Africa. However, it does not explicitly connect to the broader theme of economic exploitation and underdevelopment of Africa as directly as the slave trade does. It is more about territorial colonization.\n\nD. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia - This option suggests economic interaction between Europe and Africa, but it does not inherently imply exploitation or underdevelopment. Without additional context showing negative impacts, this option does not strongly support Rodney's assertion.\n\nTherefore, option A (The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations) best supports Walter Rodney's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment, as it exemplifies the direct exploitation of African human resources for European economic gain, which significantly contributed to the underdevelopment of the continent."}

The rulers conferred titles and authority on Kerdir, the chief priest, specifically for overseeing divine services and enhancing the religious infrastructure.\n\nThis active involvement and sponsorship of religion by the rulers, as described in the text, suggest that their political authority and legitimacy were closely tied to their role as patrons of the state religion.

The text emphasizes the importance of women being industrious, managing household duties, serving their husbands, maintaining purity, and participating in ancestral worship. The passage specifically mentions that a woman should not refuse to perform domestic duties, whether easy or difficult, and that she should be correct in manner and upright in character to serve her husband. This indicates a clear expectation for women to obediently fulfill their obligations within the home.\n\nOption A, \"That they obediently fulfill their obligations within the home,\" directly reflects the content of the passage, as it captures the essence of the expectations placed on women to manage household duties diligently and serve their husbands.\n\nOption B, \"That they collaborate with their husbands on domestic tasks,\" is not supported by the text, as it does not mention collaboration with husbands in household tasks but rather focuses on the woman's role in managing these duties.\n\nOption C, \"That they pursue education in order to find meaningful employment,\" is not mentioned in the passage. The text focuses on domestic and ritual duties rather than education or employment outside the home.\n\nOption D, \"That they speak their minds boldly,\" is also not supported by the text. The passage emphasizes purity and quietness of spirit rather than bold expression of personal opinions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. That they obediently fulfill their obligations within the home."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nWhile some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive war… most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or \"Sea of Precious Virtues,\" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.\nRobert Irwin, \"Islam and the Crusades,\" 1995\nIt is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them.

It emphasizes that if a Muslim ruler does not pursue jihad and instead makes peace with non-Muslims, he is seen as corrupting the world. This passage highlights the ideological commitment to the concept of jihad as a form of holy war, which was taken seriously by some Muslim elites during the crusading era.\n\nOption A suggests that Muslims were more peaceful than Christians, which is not supported by the passage as it discusses the obligation of jihad. Option B, which states that most Muslims were only interested in protecting their own territory, also does not align with the passage's emphasis on expanding Islamic rule. Option C, suggesting inherent violence driven by Islamic faith, is a broader and more negative interpretation that the passage does not necessarily imply, as it focuses on the duties of rulers rather than the general populace.\n\nOption D, stating that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites, directly correlates with the content of the passage. It specifically mentions the duty of Muslim rulers to engage in jihad to expand Islamic influence, reflecting a serious commitment to the ideology of holy war among some Muslim elites during the period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism.

Stalin highlights the necessity of overcoming Russia's historical backwardness in various fields such as military, culture, politics, industry, and agriculture. He uses this argument to justify the need for rapid industrial and overall national development.\n\nOption A, Stalin's drive to motivate Soviet industry for the Winter War with Finland, is not the best fit because the Winter War occurred later, from November 1939 to March 1940, and the speech was delivered in 1931. The speech does not specifically address the conflict with Finland.\n\nOption B, Stalin's push to make the Soviet Union a nuclear nation, is also not suitable because the development of nuclear capabilities began during and after World War II, well after this speech was given.\n\nOption D, Stalin's purges of dissidents and other political prisoners, although a significant aspect of Stalin's rule, is not directly related to the themes of industrial and economic development discussed in the speech.\n\nOption C, Stalin's implementation of five-year plans for the Soviet economy, aligns closely with the content of the speech. The first Five-Year Plan was initiated in 1928, focusing on rapid industrialization and the development of the Soviet economy to prevent the kind of vulnerabilities that had historically led to Russia being exploited and beaten by more advanced nations.

Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance). This statement has some merit. The Mongol rule, often referred to as the \"Tatar Yoke,\" isolated Russia from some of the developments occurring in Western Europe, such as the Renaissance. The Mongols controlled many of the trade routes and had significant influence over the political and military affairs of Russia, which limited direct interaction with Western Europe and its evolving ideas and cultural movements.\n\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity. This statement is incorrect. The administrative center of the Mongol Empire was not in Russia but rather in other parts of the vast Mongol Empire, such as Karakorum and later Khanbaliq (modern Beijing). Russia was a subjugated region under the Mongol Empire, not an administrative center.\n\nC. Islam became the dominant religion of Russia. This statement is incorrect. Although the Mongols were generally religiously tolerant and some of the Mongol khans converted to Islam, Russia predominantly remained Christian. The Russian Orthodox Church even grew in influence during the Mongol period, partly as a source of continuity and identity for the Russian people.\n\nD. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy. This statement is accurate. One of the significant impacts of Mongol rule was the strengthening of the Russian princes' authority, who had to organize more effective administrative structures to collect tribute for the Mongols. This led to the development of a more centralized bureaucracy in Russia. Over time, this centralization helped Moscow to emerge as a powerful state, particularly under the leadership of princes like Ivan III, who expanded their control and began the process of consolidating the Russian territories.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s is option D: Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy. This development was crucial for the later unification and expansion of the Russian state."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBut the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?", "choices": ["Tang and Ottoman", "Ming and Aztec", "Han and Gupta", "Qin and Etruscan"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "The passage from Edward Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" outlines several key factors contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire: the natural consequences of excessive expansion, the corruption and degradation of military discipline, and the eventual invasion by external forces. To determine which other classical empires experienced similar downfalls, we need to consider empires that faced decline due to overexpansion, military issues, and external invasions.\n\nA. Tang and Ottoman - The Tang Dynasty faced internal rebellions and external pressures that weakened the state, similar to Rome. The Ottoman Empire also experienced gradual decline due to military stagnation and administrative inefficiencies, alongside external threats.\n\nB. Ming and Aztec - The Ming Dynasty's fall was influenced by internal power struggles, peasant rebellions, and Manchu invasion, but it did not emphasize military corruption as a primary cause. The Aztec Empire was rapidly conquered by Spanish invaders, differing from the slow decline described for Rome.\n\nC. Han and Gupta - The Han Dynasty saw its decline due to a combination of internal strife, weakening central power, and external invasions, closely mirroring Rome's situation. The Gupta Empire similarly declined due to internal weaknesses and invasions by the Huns, aligning well with the Roman experience.\n\nD. Qin and Etruscan - The Qin Dynasty fell primarily due to internal revolts and the harshness of its own policies rather than prolonged military decay or external invasions. The Etruscan civilization was gradually absorbed by the Romans, and less is known about their military or administrative practices.\n\nConsidering these comparisons, option C (Han and Gupta) most closely aligns with the reasons for the decline of the Roman Empire as described by Gibbon. Both the Han and Gupta empires experienced overexpansion, military weakening, and external invasions, which are central themes in Gibbon's analysis of Rome's fall. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Han and Gupta"}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Al-Zawawi also said 'This sultan Musa told me that at a town called ZKRY he has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. \"There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in. Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

This indicates that Mali's economy was significantly bolstered by the mining and trading of minerals, specifically copper and gold. The passage does not mention large agricultural estates, conquests of pagan neighbors for wealth, or the exploitation of the slave trade as primary sources of wealth. Instead, it highlights the extraction of gold and the trade of copper for gold as key economic activities.\n\nMansa Musa's statement about the lack of duties on other goods suggests that the kingdom did not rely heavily on taxing its citizens on various goods, which could imply a reliance on a few key resources for generating wealth. The specific mention of copper and gold further supports the idea that mining and trading these minerals were crucial to Mali's economy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"When the gods fashioned Gilgamesh*, to him they gave a perfect form.

These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk.\"\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E.\n*Gilgamesh was a king of Uruk.\nWhich of the following best describes the origins of epic poetry such as the Epic of Gilgamesh?", "choices": ["The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems", "The rise of a merchant class in cities who could sponsor the creation of original art", "The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings", "The rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "The Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest known works of literature, is a narrative that primarily focuses on the heroic deeds and existential quests of its protagonist, Gilgamesh, who was a historical king of Uruk. This epic, like other early epics, serves multiple purposes: it entertains, instructs, and preserves the history and cultural values of the time. \n\nOption A suggests that the rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems is the origin of epic poetry. This is a plausible explanation because the development of writing systems and the emergence of scribes capable of recording such narratives were crucial for the creation and preservation of lengthy epic poems. The ability to write allowed for the complex stories of epics to be documented and passed down through generations, rather than relying solely on oral tradition.\n\nOption B, which credits the rise of a merchant class sponsoring the creation of original art, does not directly relate to the origins of epic poetry. While patronage of the arts is significant, the primary function of epics was not merely artistic expression but also the recording of heroic deeds and cultural values, which is less directly tied to merchant activities.\n\nOption C, attributing the origin to a religious caste dedicated to recording the deeds of God-Kings, while appealing, is not strongly supported by the text. Although religious elements and deities play roles in such epics, the texts themselves are not solely religious scriptures but narratives that also focus on human and heroic qualities.\n\nOption D, the rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording, is also a compelling choice because it highlights the content of many epics, which often celebrate the feats of warriors and heroes. However, the mere existence of a warrior class does not necessarily lead to the development of epic poetry without the means to record and narrate their deeds, which brings us back to the importance of a literate class.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is A, as the ability to record, preserve, and transmit complex narratives in a durable form (writing) is fundamental to the development and endurance of epic poetry like the Epic of Gilgamesh. This capability would have been primarily provided by a literate class of scribes."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright © 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?", "choices": ["The colonization of the interior of Africa", "The conquest of the Aztec Empire", "The reformation of Catholic Christianity", "The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To determine which option best supports Alfred Crosby's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that helped Western Europe achieve global hegemony, we need to focus on how Western Europe could have increased its productivity through exploitation of ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets outside its own territories. Crosby emphasizes the role of geographical and ecological factors, alongside the use of force, in enabling this productivity leap.\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa primarily occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, well after the period in question (1450-1750 C.E.). Therefore, it does not directly support the assertion about the quantum jump in productivity that occurred earlier.\n\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire by the Spanish in the early 16th century fits well with Crosby’s argument. This conquest allowed Western Europe, specifically Spain, to gain access to vast new resources, including precious metals like silver and gold, as well as new agricultural products. This exploitation of resources significantly boosted Spain's wealth and global influence, exemplifying the type of quantum jump in productivity Crosby describes.\n\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity, while a significant historical event, primarily pertains to religious and cultural changes within Europe. It does not directly relate to the exploitation of external ecosystems and resources that Crosby highlights as necessary for the quantum jump in productivity.\n\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan refers to Japan's self-imposed isolation from much of the international community during the Edo period, which began in the early 17th century. This policy of isolation would have limited rather than expanded European productivity and does not support Crosby’s argument about exploiting external resources.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B, the conquest of the Aztec Empire, best supports Crosby's assertion. It directly illustrates how Western Europe, through conquest and exploitation of non-European lands and resources, achieved a significant increase in productivity, which was crucial for establishing global hegemony during the period between 1450 and 1750 C.E."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.\nFirstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…\n…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only.

Luther argues against the notion that the Pope is infallible in matters of faith, regardless of his moral character, and he criticizes the Church for asserting that the Holy Ghost never leaves them, even if they are unlearned or wicked. This criticism is directed towards the Church's control over biblical interpretation and the exclusion of any other interpretations that might challenge their authority.\n\nLuther's reference to the \"second wall\" specifically targets this control over scriptural interpretation. He points out the inconsistency and self-serving nature of the Church's stance, arguing that if the Pope and the Church authorities were truly infallible due to the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, there would be no need for the Scriptures at all. This critique is focused on the monopolization of biblical interpretation by the Church, which Luther sees as a barrier to true understanding and reform.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nB.
