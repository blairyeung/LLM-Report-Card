The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants:\nThis option does not seem to directly undo the trade patterns described in the passage. The passage discusses the Portuguese trading silk, gold, musk, and porcelain from China to Japan, and bringing back silver from Japan. It does not mention the discovery of new goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from Europeans.\n\nB. Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas:\nThe Enlightenment revolutions, such as the American and French Revolutions, primarily impacted political and social structures in Europe and the Americas. While these revolutions may have indirectly affected global trade patterns, they do not seem to have directly undone the specific trade routes and goods mentioned in the passage.\n\nC. The Industrial Revolution:\nThis option seems the most likely to have directly undone the trade patterns described in the passage. The Industrial Revolution brought significant changes to global trade and transportation, including the development of steam power, railways, and steamships. These technological advancements likely disrupted the existing trade routes and goods that were being exchanged between China, Japan, and the Portuguese.\n\nD. The colonization of Africa:\nThe colonization of Africa by European powers during this time period primarily impacted trade and economic relationships in Africa itself. While it may have had indirect effects on global trade patterns, it does not seem to have directly undone the specific trade routes and goods mentioned in the passage, which were focused on the relationship between China, Japan, and the Portuguese.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the most likely answer is C. The Industrial Revolution, as it seems to have most directly impacted and disrupted the trade patterns described in the passage."}

Africa should avoid the dangers of disunity by creating a political union.\n2. A Union of African states will project the African personality more effectively and command respect from the world.\n3. The passage criticizes the lack of regard for African independence by the Great Powers, as evidenced by their responses to French atomic tests in the Sahara and the situation in the Congo.\n\nBased on these points, the ideology that Nkrumah's argument most clearly supports is:\n\nA. Pan-Africanism\n\nThe key evidence is:\n- Nkrumah advocates for a political union of African states, which is a central tenet of Pan-Africanism.\n- He argues that this union will project the \"African personality\" and command respect, which aligns with Pan-Africanism's goal of promoting African unity and identity on the global stage.\n- The criticism of the Great Powers' disregard for African independence also fits with Pan-Africanism's anti-colonial stance.\n\nThe other options are less supported by the passage:\n- B. Communism is not explicitly mentioned.\n- C. African socialism is not the primary focus, though some elements like promoting African identity could be interpreted as aligned with it.\n- D. Neocolonialism is criticized in the passage, not supported.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that Nkrumah's argument in the passage most clearly supports the ideology of Pan-Africanism."}

The key points are:\n\n1. Women are expected to perform domestic duties diligently, whether easy or difficult, and complete them in a tidy and systematic manner.\n2. Women are expected to be correct in manner, upright in character, and serve their husbands.\n3. Women are expected to live in purity and quietness of spirit, attend to their own affairs, and not engage in gossip or silly laughter.\n4. Women are expected to cleanse, purify, and arrange offerings to the ancestors.\n\nThese expectations suggest that women's lives were increasingly restricted to the private, domestic sphere, with a strong emphasis on their roles as dutiful wives and caretakers of the household. This is in contrast to the more varied roles and public participation that women may have had in pre-sedentary societies.\n\nIn pre-sedentary societies, women often participated in a wider range of activities, such as gathering, hunting, and contributing to the overall subsistence of the group. They may have held more influential positions within the community.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere."}

The Bandung Conference was a historic gathering of Asian and African nations, many of which were newly independent or in the process of gaining independence from colonial rule.\n\nIn the passage, Sukarno emphasizes the importance of preserving peace and mobilizing the political, moral, and spiritual strength of Asia and Africa in pursuit of that goal. He also notes that without peace, the revolutions and independence of these nations would have \"little meaning.\"\n\nGiven this context, the most relevant option appears to be:\n\nC. the Cold War.\n\nThe Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, with both superpowers vying for influence in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Many newly independent nations in these regions, including Indonesia under Sukarno, sought to maintain a non-aligned or neutral stance, rather than aligning with either the U.S. or the USSR.\n\nThe passage's emphasis on preserving peace and mobilizing the collective strength of Asia and Africa suggests that Sukarno was speaking in the broader context of the Cold War, rather than specific conflicts like the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Korean War, or the Vietnam conflicts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. the Cold War."}

Meritocratic appointments by rulers to their bureaucracies:\nThe passage does not mention anything about appointments to bureaucracies or a meritocratic system in Egyptian society. Instead, it focuses on a military commander's role and achievements. This option does not seem to be supported by the passage.\n\nB. Long-distance contact between Egypt and other lands:\nThe passage indicates that the ruler of Syria made the speaker (likely Sanehat) spend many years as the commander of his army, and that the speaker overcame various lands. This suggests the existence of long-distance contact and military interaction between Egypt and other lands, such as Syria. This option is supported by the information in the passage.\n\nC. The clan as the basic political unit:\nThe passage does not provide any information about the political structure or organization of Egyptian society. It focuses on the military achievements of an individual and his relationship with the ruler of Syria. There is no evidence in the passage to support the idea that the clan was the basic political unit.\n\nD. A lack of emphasis on martial ability:\nThe passage clearly emphasizes the military prowess and achievements of the speaker, who was appointed as the head of the ruler's sons due to the success of his \"handiwork\". This suggests a strong emphasis on martial ability in Egyptian society, contrary to the option presented.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is B. Long-distance contact between Egypt and other lands, as this is supported by the evidence in the passage regarding the speaker's military activities and interactions with the ruler of Syria."}

The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries\nA young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . .

The treaty placed significant territorial, military, and financial burdens on Germany, which many Germans saw as unjust punishment.\n\nThis aligns with option C, \"A widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I.\" The passage indicates that this sentiment was prevalent in Germany at the time, providing the backdrop for Hitler's condemnation of the treaty.\n\nThe other options do not seem to be directly relevant to the historical context described in the source.

The eastward expansion of Russia:\nThe eastward expansion of Russia did not have a direct impact on the trade patterns described in the passage, which focused on the Portuguese trade between Macao, Japan, and India. The Russian expansion was primarily focused on Siberia and Central Asia, not the maritime trade routes in East Asia. Therefore, this option does not seem to be the most direct cause of undoing the described trade patterns.\n\nB. The Portuguese conquest of India:\nThe Portuguese conquest of India in the early 16th century was a significant development that directly impacted the trade patterns mentioned in the passage. The Portuguese established control over important maritime trade routes and ports in India, which allowed them to dominate the trade between India, China, and Japan. This significantly altered the trade flows and dynamics described in the first paragraph. Therefore, this option seems to be the most direct cause of undoing the trade patterns.\n\nC. The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate:\nThe establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan in 1603 led to a period of isolation and reduced foreign trade that could have impacted the Portuguese trade patterns with Japan described in the passage. However, the passage is focused on events prior to 1599, so the Tokugawa Shogunate's policies came after the described trade patterns and are not the most direct cause of undoing them.\n\nD. The Spanish conquest of Mexico:\nThe Spanish conquest of Mexico in the early 16th century was a significant development, but it did not have a direct impact on the Portuguese trade patterns in East Asia mentioned in the passage. The Spanish conquest was focused on the Americas, while the passage describes trade routes and dynamics in China, Japan, and India, which were outside the Spanish sphere of influence at the time.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most direct development that likely undid the trade patterns described in the first paragraph was the Portuguese conquest of India, which allowed them to dominate the maritime trade routes and dynamics in the region. Therefore, the correct answer is B. The Portuguese conquest of India."}

The expulsion of Christian missionaries from Japan:\nThis event does not seem to directly address Lord Ii's concerns about the changing conditions of foreign states and their increasing military power. The expulsion of Christian missionaries was more focused on internal religious policies rather than Japan's changing geopolitical situation.\n\nB. The adoption of Chinese imperial customs in the Japanese court:\nThis option is also not a strong match for Lord Ii's concerns. The adoption of Chinese customs was more about cultural and political influences rather than the specific military and technological advancements that Lord Ii was worried about.\n\nC. The annexation of Manchuria by the Japanese:\nThis event is closer to addressing Lord Ii's concerns, as it reflects Japan's own efforts to expand its military power and influence in the region. However, the annexation of Manchuria occurred much later, in the 1930s, well after the time period when Lord Ii wrote his letter.\n\nD. Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade:\nThis option seems to be the best fit for Lord Ii's concerns. The arrival of Commodore Perry and the U.S. Navy in the 1850s forced Japan to end its long-standing isolationist policies and open up to increased foreign trade and interaction.

It suggests that without peace, the independence and revolutions of these regions will not be able to reach their full potential.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The formation of the non-aligned movement:\nThis option aligns well with the passage's focus on mobilizing the strength of Asia and Africa to influence world affairs. The non-aligned movement emerged in the 1950s as a group of nations that aimed to remain independent of the major power blocs of the Cold War. This matches the passage's call for the peoples of Asia and Africa to use their collective voice and influence to promote peace.\n\nB. Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation:\nWhile the passage does not directly mention disarmament or nuclear issues, its emphasis on preserving peace could be seen as indirectly supporting global efforts towards disarmament and non-proliferation. However, this is not the primary focus of the passage.\n\nC. The Green Revolution in agriculture:\nThe passage does not mention anything related to agricultural developments or the Green Revolution, so this option is not a good match.\n\nD. Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology:\nThe passage does discuss the mobilization of the peoples of Asia and Africa, which could be seen as a form of pan-Asian ideology. However, the passage's focus is more on using this collective strength to promote peace, rather than a broader pan-Asian ideological movement.\n\nBased on the analysis, the option that best matches the key points made in the passage is A. The formation of the non-aligned movement. The passage's emphasis on mobilizing the spiritual, moral, and political strength of Asia and Africa to influence world affairs aligns well with the goals and principles of the non-aligned movement that emerged in the 1950s."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": ["Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown", "Killing of civilians during wartime", "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction", "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "Based on the information provided in the passages, the forms of violence that can be connected to the context are:\n\nB. Killing of civilians during wartime\n\nThe passages describe the Cawnpore (Kanpur) massacres during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, where British civilians, including women and children, were killed by the rebelling Indian soldiers. This was not random banditry or collateral damage, but a deliberate targeting and killing of non-combatant civilians as part of the conflict between the British colonial power and the Indian rebels.\n\nThe first passage refers to this as a \"servile war\" and a \"war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge\" where the Indian rebels sought to \"shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions.\" \n\nThe second passage also discusses how the revolt shattered the British monopoly on violence in India, leading to an \"indigenous violence of the colonized\" against the British.\n\nTherefore, the forms of violence described here fit best with the \"killing of civilians during wartime\" rather than banditry, collateral damage, or state-sponsored genocide."}

So this is also not the best answer.\n\nC. Agricultural work could be shared by women and men alike.\nThe poem directly states that \"Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow, the crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.\" This indicates that women were expected to take on agricultural work typically seen as men's work, suggesting a more egalitarian gender division of labor.

Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance):\nThe passage mentions that the Mongol domains \"served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere\" and that trade routes facilitated the \"spread of foods [and] inventions... a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\" This suggests that the Mongol conquest and control of the region actually facilitated the spread of ideas and inventions, rather than excluding Russia from Western European developments.\n\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity:\nThe passage does not provide any information to suggest that Russia became the administrative center of Mongol political activity. It simply states that the Mongol domains covered a vast realm, without specifying Russia as the administrative center.\n\nC. Islam became the dominant religion of Russia:\nThe passage states that \"virtually all religions were tolerated\" under the Mongol khans, suggesting that the Mongols did not impose a single dominant religion in their domains. There is no evidence provided that Islam became the dominant religion in Russia specifically.\n\nD. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy:\nThe passage mentions that the \"law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction\" and that this resulted in \"an important new stage in international contact.\" This indicates that the Mongol rule led to the establishment of a centralized legal and administrative system that facilitated trade and travel across their domains. It is reasonable to infer that this could have contributed to the development of a centralized bureaucracy in Russia as well.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s was that Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy (option D). The passage suggests that the Mongol political and administrative structures facilitated the spread of ideas and inventions, rather than excluding Russia from Western European developments (option A), and there is no evidence that Russia became the administrative center of Mongol activity (option B) or that Islam became the dominant religion (option C)."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBut the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?", "choices": ["Tang and Ottoman", "Ming and Aztec", "Han and Gupta", "Qin and Etruscan"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "To determine which other classical empires the reasons given in the passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to, I will analyze the key factors mentioned in the passage and consider which other empires may have experienced similar dynamics.\n\nThe key factors mentioned are:\n1. Immoderate greatness/prosperity leading to the principle of decay\n2. Causes of destruction multiplying with the extent of conquest\n3. Removal of artificial supports leading to the collapse of the \"stupendous fabric\"\n4. Victorious legions acquiring the vices of strangers and mercenaries, oppressing the freedom of the republic and violating the majesty of the purple\n5. Emperors corrupting the military discipline to ensure personal safety and public peace\n6. Weakening of the military vigor leading to the Roman world being \"overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians\"\n\nLooking at these factors, the empires that seem most comparable would be:\n\nC. Han and Gupta\n\nBoth the Han and Gupta empires were classical empires that experienced significant expansion and prosperity, which could have led to factors like growing corruption, overreliance on mercenary forces, and military decline - similar to what is described for the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Han and Gupta empires also eventually faced external pressures from nomadic groups and invasions, which could be analogous to the \"deluge of Barbarians\" that overwhelmed the Roman world.\n\nSo based on the key factors mentioned in the passage, the Han and Gupta empires seem like the most appropriate classical empires to which the reasons for the fall of Rome could also be applied.\n\nThe other options (A and B) do not seem as strong of a match, as the Tang, Ottoman, Ming, and Aztec empires were from different time periods and geographic regions, and may not have experienced the same dynamics as the Roman, Han, and Gupta empires.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is C. Han and Gupta."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Al-Zawawi also said 'This sultan Musa told me that at a town called ZKRY he has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. \"There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in. Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P. Hopkins, eds. Corpus of Early\nArabic Sources for West African History. Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1981. Reprinted with permission of\nCambridge University Press.\nAl' Umari, ca. 1300–1384\nBased on your knowledge of world history and the passage, Mansa Musa's assertion about the lack of duties levied on goods in his kingdom most strongly reflects which of the following about the kingdom of Mali?", "choices": ["Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals.", "Mali's wealth came in large part from its conquest of pagan neighbors.", "Mali's wealth came in large part from large agricultural estates.", "Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To determine the answer, I will carefully analyze the information provided in the passage and evaluate how it relates to the potential answers.\n\nA. Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals:\nThe passage explicitly states that Mansa Musa said \"there is nothing in my kingdom on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in.\" It also mentions that Mansa Musa employed pagan nations to extract gold from deposits in his kingdom. This strongly suggests that the exploitation of minerals, particularly copper and gold, was a significant source of Mali's wealth. The passage provides clear evidence supporting option A.\n\nB. Mali's wealth came in large part from its conquest of pagan neighbors:\nThe passage does not mention anything about Mali conquering pagan neighbors or using tribute from conquered lands as a major source of wealth. In fact, it states that Mansa Musa did not collect tribute (jizya) from the pagan nations in his kingdom, but rather employed them to extract gold. This contradicts the idea that Mali's wealth came from conquering pagan neighbors.\n\nC. Mali's wealth came in large part from large agricultural estates:\nThe passage does not provide any information about Mali having large agricultural estates or the wealth coming from agriculture. The focus is entirely on the extraction and trade of minerals, particularly copper and gold. There is no evidence in the passage to support option C.\n\nD. Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade:\nThe passage does not mention anything about the slave trade or the exploitation of slaves as a source of Mali's wealth. The focus is on the mining and trading of minerals, with no references to the slave trade.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the answer that most strongly reflects Mansa Musa's assertion about the lack of duties levied on goods in his kingdom is option A - Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"When the gods fashioned Gilgamesh*, to him they gave a perfect form.

This suggests that the epic is rooted in the culture and accomplishments of a specific urban civilization.\n\nOption A, \"The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems,\" seems the most plausible. The passage indicates that the epic was recorded, likely by scribes who had the ability to write down the oral traditions and stories of Gilgamesh's deeds and the history of Uruk. The development of literacy and a class of scribes in urban centers would have enabled the recording of epics like this one.\n\nOption B, \"The rise of a merchant class in cities who could sponsor the creation of original art,\" is less likely. While merchant classes in cities may have played a role in sponsoring the arts, the passage does not suggest that commercial interests were the primary driver behind the creation of the Epic of Gilgamesh.\n\nOption C, \"The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings,\" is also less convincing. The passage does not specifically mention a religious caste responsible for recording the epic. While the epic does reference the gods and Gilgamesh's divine attributes, it seems more focused on the historical and architectural details of the city of Uruk.\n\nOption D, \"The rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording,\" is not the best fit. While Gilgamesh is described as a powerful and heroic figure, the passage emphasizes more the civic and architectural achievements of Uruk rather than Gilgamesh's exploits as a warrior.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the best answer is Option A, \"The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems.\""}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright © 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?", "choices": ["The colonization of the interior of Africa", "The conquest of the Aztec Empire", "The reformation of Catholic Christianity", "The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To determine the best answer that supports the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that helped Western Europe achieve global hegemony, I will evaluate each of the provided options:\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa:\nThis option could support the author's assertion, as the colonization of Africa allowed Western Europe to exploit the continent's ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets, which could have contributed to the \"quantum jump\" in productivity needed to achieve global hegemony. The author specifically mentions the exploitation of \"whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump\" as a critical factor.\n\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire:\nThe conquest of the Aztec Empire in the Americas could also support the author's assertion, as it allowed Western Europe to gain access to new resources and territories that could have contributed to the \"quantum jump\" in productivity. The author mentions the importance of \"exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents\" in achieving global hegemony.\n\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity:\nThe reformation of Catholic Christianity is unlikely to directly support the author's assertion about the \"quantum jump\" in productivity. The reformation was primarily a religious and cultural event that did not significantly impact the exploitation of resources or the increase in productivity that the author mentions as critical factors.\n\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan:\nThe isolationism of Tokugawa Japan is also unlikely to support the author's assertion, as it was a policy that prevented Japan from engaging with the rest of the world and accessing the resources and territories that the author cites as crucial for the \"quantum jump\" in productivity.\n\nBased on the information provided, the options that best support the author's assertion are A (the colonization of the interior of Africa) and B (the conquest of the Aztec Empire), as they both involve the exploitation of new resources and territories outside of Western Europe, which the author suggests was crucial for achieving the \"quantum jump\" in productivity necessary for global hegemony."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.\nFirstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…\n…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.\"\nMartin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520\nWhen the author of the passage above discusses the \"second wall,\" to what is he referring?", "choices": ["The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate definition of \"Holy Ghost\"", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate theological belief about the divinity of Jesus", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate method of baptism"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "Based on the passage, the author is referring to the Catholic claim that \"they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life.\" \n\nThe \"second wall\" that the author describes is the Catholic position that they have the sole authority to interpret the Scriptures, and that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith. The author argues that this claim is \"even more tottering and weak\" than the first wall, which was the claim that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over the spiritual power.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts."}
