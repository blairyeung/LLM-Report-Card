Nkrumah emphasizes the importance of African unity, stating that a \"Union of African states\" is necessary to avoid the dangers of disunity and to project the \"African personality.\"\n2. He argues that a unified Africa will command respect from the world, implying that individual African states are not taken seriously by the global community.\n3. He criticizes the Great Powers for disregarding African independence, citing the examples of the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the UN's inaction in the Congo.\n\nBased on these points, Nkrumah's argument is most closely aligned with Pan-Africanism, which emphasizes the unity and solidarity of African nations and peoples. Pan-Africanism seeks to promote African independence, self-determination, and collective action to address common challenges and promote African interests.\n\nWhile Nkrumah's views may also be influenced by socialism or anti-colonialism, the passage does not provide sufficient evidence to support communism (B) or African socialism (C) as the primary ideology. Neocolonialism (D) is actually the opposite of Nkrumah's argument, as he is advocating for African independence and self-determination, rather than continued colonial or imperial influence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.

This verse celebrates the joy of drinking wine when the roses are in bloom, which seems to contradict the Islamic prohibition on strong drink.\n\nGiven these two verses, we can infer that Omar Khayyám, a Muslim poet, is not adhering to the Islamic prohibition on drinking wine. This suggests that not all Muslims observed the religious restrictions universally.\n\nTherefore, the comparison of both verses best supports the conclusion that:\n\nB.

The Australian act prohibits the entry of individuals who fail to demonstrate a certain level of literacy in a European language, those who may become a public charge, and those under contract to perform manual labor (with some exceptions). The US act specifically targets Chinese laborers, suspending their entry into the country and imposing penalties on those who bring them in.\n\nConsidering these restrictions, it's clear that both acts reflect a growing concern about the impact of immigration on the host countries. The restrictions are not primarily driven by economic protectionism (B), as they do not focus on protecting domestic industries or jobs. Nor do they reflect a desire to attract skilled labor from abroad (C), as the restrictions are more focused on exclusion than inclusion.\n\nThe rise of anti-Semitic ideologies (A) is not directly relevant to these passages, as they do not specifically target Jewish immigrants.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is D. Hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment. Both acts demonstrate a growing concern about the impact of immigration on the host countries and a desire to restrict the entry of certain groups of people, reflecting a hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": ["Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown", "Killing of civilians during wartime", "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction", "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To determine the best connection between the passages and a form of violence, let's analyze the key points from the texts:\n\n1.

The violence was a response to British rule and the perceived superiority of the British over the Indians.\n3. The British had a monopoly on violence, which was challenged by the Indian revolt.\n4. The violence was not just a random act, but a deliberate attempt to target and destroy the British presence in India.\n\nConsidering these points, the best connection is with option B: Killing of civilians during wartime. The Cawnpore massacres were a deliberate attack on British civilians during a time of conflict, which is a characteristic of this form of violence.\n\nOption A, Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown, is not relevant to the context of the passages, which describe a large-scale, organized attack on British civilians.\n\nOption C, Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction, is also not relevant, as the passages do not mention the use of such weapons.\n\nOption D, State-sponsored campaigns of genocide, is not the best fit, as the passages describe a rebellion against British rule, rather than a state-sponsored campaign of violence."}

The passage states that \"most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam.\" This suggests that many Muslim leaders and scholars believed that jihad was a fundamental duty that should be pursued until Islam had spread globally. Additionally, the passage quotes the Bahr al-Fava'id, which emphasizes the importance of prosecuting jihad and warns that a Muslim ruler who fails to do so is corrupting the world.\n\nGiven this information, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA. This passage does not provide evidence that Muslims were more peaceful than Christians during the crusading era. In fact, it suggests the opposite.\n\nB. This passage does not support the idea that Muslims were only interested in protecting their own territory. Instead, it suggests that many Muslims believed in expanding Islam's reach through jihad.\n\nC. While the passage does suggest that some Muslims were driven by their faith to pursue jihad, it does not imply that they were inherently violent. The emphasis is on the ideological and religious motivations behind jihad, rather than any inherent violent tendencies.\n\nD. This passage strongly supports the idea that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era. The quotes from the Bahr al-Fava'id and the emphasis on the obligation of jihad suggest that many Muslim leaders and scholars believed in the importance of pursuing jihad.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism.

Stalin emphasizes the importance of not falling behind and the need to overcome Russia's historical backwardness. He mentions the country's past defeats and the exploitation it suffered due to its weakness. He also uses the phrase \"we must no longer lag behind,\" which suggests a sense of urgency and a need for rapid progress.\n\nConsidering these points, the speech appears to be focused on the need for rapid industrialization and modernization. This is consistent with Stalin's implementation of five-year plans for the Soviet economy, which aimed to rapidly industrialize the country and catch up with Western nations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Winter War with Finland did not occur until 1939-1940, eight years after the speech was delivered. Option B is also incorrect because the Soviet Union did not begin its nuclear program until the 1940s.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n—Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

This decision was made in the context of the end of World War II, when the Japanese were surrendering and the Allies were determining the post-war occupation of Korea.\n\nNow, let's consider the potential impact of these events on Koreans:\n\n* Option A, \"They became a part of Japan's territory,\" is incorrect because the passage actually describes the end of Japanese occupation of Korea.\n* Option B, \"The Americans established freedom for all Koreans,\" is also incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the Americans were able to establish freedom for all Koreans. In fact, the division of Korea along the 38th parallel may have ultimately led to the division of the country into two separate nations.\n* Option C, \"The Korean economy never recovered,\" is not directly supported by the passage, which does not discuss the economic impact of the events on Korea.\n* Option D, \"Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel,\" is the most plausible answer. The passage describes the division of Korea along the 38th parallel, which ultimately led to the establishment of two separate governments in North and South Korea.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants.

The Aztec Empire (1325-1521 CE) in Mesoamerica was conquered by the Spanish, but its decline was not necessarily due to internal decay or corruption of military discipline.\n\nC. Han and Gupta: The Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) in China declined due to internal strife, regionalism, and external pressures, which led to the weakening of its military and the eventual collapse of the empire. The Gupta Empire (320-550 CE) in ancient India declined due to internal decay, external pressures from neighboring kingdoms, and the weakening of its military.\n\nD. Qin and Etruscan: The Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE) in China was short-lived and declined due to internal strife and external pressures. The Etruscan civilization (900-100 BCE) in ancient Italy declined due to internal decay and external pressures from the Romans.\n\nConsidering the reasons given in the passage, the most suitable answer is C. Han and Gupta. Both empires experienced internal decay, external pressures, and the weakening of their military, which are similar to the factors that contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Al-Zawawi also said 'This sultan Musa told me that at a town called ZKRY he has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. \"There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in. Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P. Hopkins, eds. Corpus of Early\nArabic Sources for West African History. Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1981. Reprinted with permission of\nCambridge University Press.\nAl' Umari, ca. 1300–1384\nBased on your knowledge of world history and the passage, Mansa Musa's assertion about the lack of duties levied on goods in his kingdom most strongly reflects which of the following about the kingdom of Mali?", "choices": ["Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals.", "Mali's wealth came in large part from its conquest of pagan neighbors.", "Mali's wealth came in large part from large agricultural estates.", "Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the passage and the options provided.\n\nThe passage mentions that Mansa Musa stated that \"there is nothing in my kingdom... on which a duty is levied except this crude copper.\" This suggests that copper is a significant commodity in the kingdom of Mali, and that it is one of the few goods that is subject to taxation.\n\nAdditionally, the passage mentions that the copper is sold to the pagan Sudan for two-thirds of its weight in gold, which implies that the kingdom of Mali is generating significant revenue from the sale of copper.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals. This option is supported by the passage, which highlights the importance of copper mining and trade in the kingdom of Mali.\n\nB. Mali's wealth came in large part from its conquest of pagan neighbors. While the passage does mention pagan nations in the kingdom, it does not suggest that the kingdom's wealth comes from conquest. Instead, it mentions that the pagan nations are employed in extracting gold, which implies a more collaborative relationship.\n\nC. Mali's wealth came in large part from large agricultural estates. There is no mention of agriculture or large estates in the passage, so this option is not supported.\n\nD. Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade. There is no mention of the slave trade in the passage, so this option is not supported.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals."}

This was a time when cities were emerging in Mesopotamia, and writing was becoming more widespread.\n\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh itself is a poem that tells the story of a king, Gilgamesh, who was two-thirds god and one-third man. The poem describes his heroic deeds, including the building of the city of Uruk and its walls.\n\nConsidering the context and the content of the poem, we can infer that the origins of epic poetry like the Epic of Gilgamesh are likely linked to the rise of cities and the emergence of a literate class of scribes who could record poems.\n\nOption A, \"The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems,\" seems to be the most plausible explanation. The fact that the Epic of Gilgamesh was written down and has survived to this day suggests that there was a class of scribes who were able to record and preserve the poem.\n\nThe other options are less convincing. Option B, \"The rise of a merchant class in cities who could sponsor the creation of original art,\" is possible but not directly supported by the text. Option C, \"The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings,\" is too narrow and doesn't account for the broader cultural context in which epic poetry emerged. Option D, \"The rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording,\" is also possible but doesn't fully capture the significance of the literate class of scribes in recording and preserving the poem.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the final verdict is:\n\nA. The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright © 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?", "choices": ["The colonization of the interior of Africa", "The conquest of the Aztec Empire", "The reformation of Catholic Christianity", "The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To support the author's assertion, we need to find an example that demonstrates how Western Europe exploited the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside its lands, leading to a significant increase in productivity and ultimately contributing to its global hegemony.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa: While European colonization of Africa did occur, it was not a significant factor in Western Europe's rise to global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E. The colonization of Africa was more prominent during the 19th century.\n\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire: This option is a strong candidate. The conquest of the Aztec Empire by the Spanish in the early 16th century led to the exploitation of the empire's rich mineral resources, including gold and silver. This influx of wealth and resources contributed significantly to the growth of Western European economies and helped to fuel their expansion.\n\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity: While the Protestant Reformation had significant social and cultural impacts on Western Europe, it is not directly related to the exploitation of external resources or the increase in productivity that the author is discussing.\n\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan: This option is not relevant to the author's assertion, as it refers to a policy of Japan, not Western Europe.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer is B. The conquest of the Aztec Empire. This event demonstrates how Western Europe exploited the resources of another continent, contributing to its rise to global hegemony."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.\nFirstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…\n…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only.

The second wall is described as \"even more tottering and weak\". Luther argues that the Catholics claim to be the sole interpreters of the Scriptures, despite being unlearned and wicked. He criticizes their assumption of authority and their claim that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is clear that the \"second wall\" refers to the differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the interpretation and use of biblical texts. Luther is challenging the Catholic Church's claim to be the sole authority on Scripture and arguing that this claim is unfounded and arrogant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts."}
