The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants: This option suggests that the trade patterns were disrupted because the Chinese became interested in new goods from European merchants. However, the text does not indicate that the Chinese were interested in purchasing goods from the Portuguese, but rather that the Portuguese were interested in purchasing goods from the Chinese. Therefore, this option does not seem to directly address the trade patterns mentioned.\n\nB. Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas: These revolutions led to significant changes in politics, economy, and society in Europe and the Americas, but they do not directly relate to the trade patterns between the Portuguese, Japan, and China. Therefore, this option does not seem to be the most direct cause of the disruption of the trade patterns.\n\nC. The Industrial Revolution: The Industrial Revolution led to significant changes in the global economy, including the development of new industries, technologies, and trade patterns. One of the key effects of the Industrial Revolution was the shift from traditional trade patterns, such as the one described in the text, to more modern and globalized trade patterns. The Industrial Revolution also led to the development of new industries, such as textiles, which could be produced more cheaply and efficiently in Europe and other parts of the world, reducing the need for Chinese silk and other luxury goods. Therefore, this option seems to be the most direct cause of the disruption of the trade patterns mentioned.\n\nD. The colonization of Africa: The colonization of Africa did lead to significant changes in global trade patterns, but it did not directly relate to the trade patterns between the Portuguese, Japan, and China.

This suggests a desire for a unified African identity and a collective voice on the global stage.\n2. **Projecting African personality**: By creating a union, Africa can project its personality more effectively, implying that Nkrumah values African self-expression and autonomy.\n3. **Respect from the world**: Nkrumah argues that a unified Africa will command respect from the world, which has historically disregarded African interests. This indicates a desire for recognition and equality.\n4. **Critique of colonialism and neocolonialism**: Nkrumah mentions the \"callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers,\" suggesting that he is critical of colonialism and neocolonialism, which often involve external powers exerting influence over African nations.\n\nConsidering these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **Pan-Africanism**: This ideology emphasizes African unity, solidarity, and self-determination. Nkrumah's argument aligns closely with these principles, as he advocates for a unified Africa that can project its personality and command respect from the world.\n\nB. **Communism**: While Nkrumah's critique of colonialism and neocolonialism might suggest some affinity with communist ideology, there is no explicit mention of Marxist or communist principles in the passage.\n\nC. **African socialism**: This ideology combines elements of socialism with African cultural and economic contexts. While Nkrumah's emphasis on unity and self-determination might be compatible with African socialism, the passage does not provide sufficient evidence to support this ideology specifically.\n\nD. **Neocolonialism**: Nkrumah's critique of colonialism and neocolonialism suggests that he is opposed to neocolonialism, which involves the continued influence of external powers over African nations.\n\nBased on the analysis, Nkrumah's argument most clearly supports **Pan-Africanism**, as it emphasizes African unity, self-determination, and the projection of African personality on the global stage."}

The Sultan mentions that he collects duty on the copper, but not on anything else, and that he sells the copper for gold in the land of the pagan Sudan. He also mentions that he employs pagan nations in his kingdom to extract gold from its deposits.\n\nNow, let's examine each statement:\n\nA. Religions were often spread through warfare during the period.\n\nThere is no mention of warfare or the spread of religions in the passage. Therefore, this statement is not supported.\n\nB. International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\n\nThe passage describes a trade connection between the Sultan's kingdom and the land of the pagan Sudan, where copper is traded for gold. This suggests that international trade connections were already established during this period. Therefore, this statement is supported.\n\nC. Diseases spread along trade routes.\n\nThere is no mention of diseases in the passage. Therefore, this statement is not supported.\n\nD. Nomadic migrations created powerful empires during the period.\n\nThe passage does not mention nomadic migrations or the creation of powerful empires. Therefore, this statement is not supported.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. International trade connections were still being developed in the period."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nNo task is more urgent than that of preserving peace. Without peace our independence means little. The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.\nIndonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955\nThe passage above is most associated with which of the following developments?", "choices": ["The formation of the non-aligned movement", "Global disarmanent and nuclear non-proliferation", "The Green Revolution in agriculture", "Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "Before making a final verdict, let's analyze the passage and the options:\n\nThe passage is a keynote address by Sukarno, the Indonesian leader, to the Bandung Conference in 1955. The conference was a significant event in the history of international relations, where representatives from 29 countries from Asia and Africa gathered to promote economic and cultural cooperation, as well as to advocate for peace and independence.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\nA. The formation of the non-aligned movement: The Bandung Conference is often seen as a precursor to the non-aligned movement, which was a group of countries that sought to maintain their independence and sovereignty in the face of the Cold War. The conference's emphasis on peace, independence, and cooperation among Asian and African countries aligns with the principles of the non-aligned movement.\n\nB. Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation: While the passage mentions the importance of peace, it does not specifically address disarmament or nuclear non-proliferation. These issues were not as prominent in the 1950s as they are today.\n\nC. The Green Revolution in agriculture: The Green Revolution was a movement that aimed to increase agricultural productivity in developing countries through the use of high-yielding crop varieties and modern farming techniques. There is no mention of agriculture or the Green Revolution in the passage.\n\nD. Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology: While the passage does emphasize the importance of Asian and African cooperation, it does not specifically promote a pan-Asian ideology. The focus is on promoting peace, independence, and cooperation among countries, rather than on promoting a specific ideology.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would argue that the passage is most associated with the formation of the non-aligned movement (Option A). The conference's emphasis on peace, independence, and cooperation among Asian and African countries aligns with the principles of the non-aligned movement, and the passage's language and tone suggest a strong connection to this development."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nO ye who believe! Strong drink and games of chance and idols… are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork. Leave it aside in order that ye may succeed.\nthe Qur'an, Sura 5: 89\nWhen once you hear the roses are in bloom,\nThen is the time, my love, to pour the wine.\nthe Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám\nA comparison of both verses would best support which of the following conclusions?", "choices": ["Many Muslims inclined toward atheism in the premodern era.", "Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims.", "Christian missionaries were steadily winning converts among Muslim populations.", "Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice."], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "Let's analyze the information provided by the two verses.\n\nThe first verse, from the Qur'an, explicitly prohibits the consumption of strong drink and participation in games of chance, labeling them as \"an infamy of Satan's handiwork.\" This suggests that these activities are considered sinful or un-Islamic.\n\nThe second verse, from the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, appears to be a poetic invitation to indulge in wine and revelry when the roses are in bloom. This verse seems to be celebrating the joy of life and the beauty of nature, but it also explicitly mentions wine, which is prohibited in the Qur'an.\n\nGiven this comparison, we can infer that the poet, Omar Khayyám, is not adhering to the Islamic prohibition on strong drink. This suggests that not all Muslims, or at least not all Muslim intellectuals, were strictly observing the religious restrictions on these activities.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that best supports the comparison of both verses is:\n\nB. Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the apparent contradiction between the Qur'anic prohibition and the poetic celebration of wine."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAn Act to place certain restrictions on Immigration and to provide for the removal from the Commonwealth of Prohibited Immigrants.\n…\n3. The immigration into the Commonwealth of the persons described in any of the following paragraphs in this section (hereinafter called \"prohibited immigrants\") is prohibited, namely\n(a) Any person who when asked to do so by an officer fails to write out at dictation and sign in the presence of the officer a passage of fifty words in length in a European language directed by the officer;\n(b) Any person in the opinion of the Minister or of an officer to become a charge upon the public or upon any public or charitable organisation;\n…\n(g) Any persons under a contract or agreement to perform manual labour within the Commonwealth: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to workmen exempted by the Minister for special skill required by Australia…\nImmigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia)\nWhereas in the opinion of the Government of the United States the coming of Chinese laborers to this country endangers the good order of certain localities within the territory thereof;\nTherefore,\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That from and after the expiration of ninety days next after the passage of this act, the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States be suspended; and during such suspension it shall not be lawful for any Chinese laborer to come, or having so come after the expiration of said ninety days to remain within the United States.\nSEC. 2. That the master of every vessel who shall knowingly bring within the United States on such vessel, and land or permit to be landed, any Chinese laborer, from any foreign port or place, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars for each and every such Chinese laborer so brought, and may be also imprisoned for a term not exceeding one year….\nChinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States)\nThe passages are best seen as examples of which prominent social or economic trend from the 1800s?", "choices": ["The rise of anti-Semitic ideologies", "Trade protectionism", "A growing desire to attract skilled labor from abroad", "Hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment"], "answer": 3, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the passages and the historical context of the 1800s.\n\nThe Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia) and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States) both contain provisions that restrict immigration based on certain criteria, such as language proficiency, potential burden on public resources, and nationality (in the case of Chinese laborers).\n\nThe Australian Act prohibits the immigration of \"prohibited immigrants,\" including those who cannot write out a passage in a European language, those who may become a charge on the public or charitable organizations, and contract laborers. The US Act suspends the coming of Chinese laborers to the US and imposes penalties on vessel masters who bring Chinese laborers into the country.\n\nConsidering the historical context of the 1800s, we can see that both acts reflect a growing concern about immigration and its perceived impact on the economy and society. This concern is not specifically related to anti-Semitic ideologies (A), as there is no mention of Jews or Jewish immigration in the passages. Trade protectionism (B) is also not directly relevant, as the acts focus on restricting immigration rather than protecting domestic industries.\n\nThe desire to attract skilled labor from abroad (C) is actually the opposite of what is reflected in the passages. The Australian Act excludes contract laborers, and the US Act specifically targets Chinese laborers, implying a desire to limit the influx of unskilled or low-skilled workers.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer is D) Hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment. Both acts demonstrate a growing concern about immigration and a desire to restrict the flow of immigrants into the country, particularly those perceived as unskilled or undesirable. This sentiment is a prominent social and economic trend of the 1800s, reflecting a shift towards more restrictive immigration policies."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": ["Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown", "Killing of civilians during wartime", "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction", "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "Before making a final verdict, let's analyze the passages and the options provided.\n\nThe passages describe the Cawnpore massacres, a brutal event that occurred during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The descriptions emphasize the racial and colonial context of the violence, highlighting the British dominance and the Indians' desire for independence and revenge. The passages also discuss the concept of violence as a monopoly of power, with the British exercising violence as a means of maintaining their authority over the Indians.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\nA. Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown: This option does not accurately capture the context of the Cawnpore massacres. While socio-economic factors may have contributed to the rebellion, the passages emphasize the racial and colonial aspects of the violence.\n\nB. Killing of civilians during wartime: This option is closer to the truth, as the Cawnpore massacres did involve the killing of civilians, including women and children. However, it does not fully capture the colonial and racial dynamics at play.\n\nC. Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction: This option is not relevant to the Cawnpore massacres, as the violence was not caused by modern weapons of mass destruction.\n\nD. State-sponsored campaigns of genocide: This option is the most accurate, as the passages describe the Cawnpore massacres as a brutal and systematic event perpetrated by a subject race against their colonial rulers. The passages also highlight the racial and colonial context of the violence, which is characteristic of state-sponsored campaigns of genocide.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that the correct answer is:\n\nD. State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"}

The genealogy is derived from the maternal side. This is a cultural practice mentioned in the passage, but it's not necessarily evidence that they take their Muslim faith seriously. In fact, this practice is mentioned as a distinct aspect of their culture, separate from their Islamic faith.\n\nB. They study Islamic law faithfully. This option suggests that the Malians are committed to learning and following Islamic law, which is a key aspect of their faith. This is a strong indication that they take their Muslim faith seriously.\n\nC. The men do not yield to sexual jealousy. While this is an interesting cultural practice, it's not directly related to their faith or commitment to Islam.\n\nD. They enjoy friendship with all, regardless of gender. This option describes a cultural practice, but it's not necessarily evidence that they take their Muslim faith seriously. In fact, the passage suggests that their friendship with people of the opposite sex is not necessarily a reflection of their faith, but rather a cultural norm.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer is B. They study Islamic law faithfully. This option provides the strongest evidence that the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nThe city of Ghana consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . .

This suggests that the author is frustrated with the situation and feels that he is not being adequately compensated for his losses.\n\nThe author then mentions that he is suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives (Zulus) who have encamped near his property. This suggests that the author is seeking redress from the British government for the harm caused by the Zulus.\n\nConsidering these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment?", "choices": ["The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations", "The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market", "The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company", "The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To determine which option best supports the author's assertion, let's analyze each choice in relation to the author's argument.\n\nThe author argues that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment by actively extending their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa. This implies that the exploitation was a deliberate and systematic effort by Western European capitalists to extract wealth from Africa.\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations: This option directly supports the author's assertion. The slave trade was a key mechanism by which Western European capitalists exploited African labor, draining Africa of its human resources and contributing to its underdevelopment. This action aligns with the author's argument that Western European capitalists actively extended their exploitation to cover the whole of Africa.\n\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market: This option does not directly support the author's assertion. While the slave trade was a significant factor in African underdevelopment, the author specifically targets Western European capitalists as the primary agents of exploitation. Arabian merchants are not mentioned in the author's argument, so this option does not directly support the author's claim.\n\nC. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company: This option does not directly support the author's assertion. While the Dutch East India Company was a Western European capitalist entity, the establishment of Cape Colony was primarily a strategic move to control trade routes and access to the Indian Ocean. This action does not directly demonstrate the exploitation of Africa's resources or labor that the author argues was a key factor in African underdevelopment.\n\nD. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia: This option does not directly support the author's assertion. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia would likely have benefited Ethiopia, rather than contributing to its underdevelopment. This option does not demonstrate the exploitation of Africa's resources or labor that the author argues was a key factor in African underdevelopment.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A is the best choice because it directly supports the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment through the aggressive expansion of the slave trade."}

It describes how these kings conferred authority and power on Kerdir, created a higher rank and dignity for him, and entrusted him with important responsibilities, such as performing divine services and establishing Warham fires.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the kings derived their legitimacy for their rule, at least in part, from their sponsorship of religion and their chief priests. The inscription suggests that the kings saw the promotion of the Mazdayanian religion and the magi as a means of enhancing their own authority and dignity. This is evident in the fact that the kings conferred authority and power on Kerdir, a chief priest, and entrusted him with important responsibilities.\n\nWhile the inscription does not provide direct evidence for the other options, we can consider them in light of the information provided.\n\nOption B, \"Rulers were limited in their political authority by powerful religious figures,\" is not supported by the inscription. The inscription suggests that the kings were able to confer authority and power on Kerdir, a chief priest, and that they saw the promotion of the Mazdayanian religion as a means of enhancing their own authority.\n\nOption C, \"Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through victories over foreign peoples,\" is not mentioned in the inscription. While the inscription does mention the establishment of Warham fires, which may have been a means of asserting the empire's power and influence, it does not suggest that the kings derived their legitimacy from military victories.\n\nOption D, \"Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through the consent of those they governed,\" is not supported by the inscription. The inscription does not suggest that the kings derived their legitimacy from the consent of their subjects. Instead, it suggests that the kings derived their legitimacy from their sponsorship of religion and their chief priests.\n\nBased on the information provided in the inscription, the most plausible inference is that rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests.\n\nThe final answer is A."}

She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity.

Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries.

The Mongol law code facilitated international contact, trade, and the exchange of ideas, inventions, and food across their territories, which spanned from Eastern Europe to Southern China.\n\nConsidering the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s, we can infer that:\n\n* Option A is unlikely, as the Mongol conquest would have facilitated trade and cultural exchange between Russia and Western Europe, rather than excluding Russia from these developments.\n* Option B is also unlikely, as the Mongols did not establish Russia as their administrative center. Instead, they likely used existing cities or established new ones as centers of power.\n* Option C is incorrect, as the Mongols were not known for promoting Islam as the dominant religion in their territories. While they did interact with Muslim populations, they generally tolerated and respected the existing religious practices of the peoples they conquered.\n* Option D is the most plausible consequence. The Mongol conquest and subsequent rule would have likely led to the development of a centralized bureaucracy in Russia, as the Mongols were known for their efficient administrative systems and ability to govern vast territories.\n\nTherefore, the most likely long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s is:\n\nD.

The passage states that the kingdom collects duty only on crude copper brought in from the copper mine, and that the gold is extracted from its deposits by employing pagan nations in the kingdom. This suggests that the kingdom's wealth was heavily reliant on the extraction and trade of these minerals.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the passage does not provide direct evidence of the kingdom's wealth coming from conquest of pagan neighbors or large agricultural estates. While the passage does mention the employment of pagan nations in extracting gold, it does not suggest that this was a result of conquest. Similarly, there is no mention of agricultural estates or the slave trade.\n\nTherefore, while option A is the most strongly supported by the passage, it's worth considering the other options and the potential limitations of the passage in providing a complete picture of the kingdom of Mali's wealth."}
