{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?", "choices": ["They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.", "They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.", "They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.", "They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology."], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "Based on the information provided in the passage, the most accurate answer is C. The passage explains that China faced threats mainly from highly mobile steppe nomads, for whom early gunpowder weapons were not effective due to their unwieldiness. As a result, China focused on improving its horse archer units, which were better suited to combat their primary foe. This decision to prioritize the development of weapons that aligned with their immediate military needs rather than investing in gunpowder weaponry that was not as effective against their specific threats explains why the Chinese did not lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?", "choices": ["The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India", "British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company", "Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority", "The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government"], "answer": 3, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "Based on the information provided in the passages, the short-term outcome of the events discussed would most likely be:\n\nD. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government\n\nThe passages describe a violent revolt by Indian rebels against British rule, with a focus on the Cawnpore massacres during the Indian Mutiny of 1857. The British rule in India is portrayed as an autocracy that had a monopoly on violence, which was challenged by the indigenous violence of the colonized. The revolt shattered the British monopoly on violence and led to a direct confrontation between the British forces and the Indian rebels. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the short-term outcome would involve the defeat of the Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government to reestablish control and suppress further uprisings."}

On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land.

Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals.

Given this context, it is important to consider the historical dynamics of trading contacts between Sub-Saharan Africans and Europeans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. \n\nOption A suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants for sustaining population growth through the importation of New World foodstuffs. While trade with Europeans did introduce new crops to Africa, it is important to note that this trade relationship was not necessarily beneficial for Africans as it often led to exploitation and economic disadvantage.\n\nOption B states that Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with Europeans for firearms. This option is plausible as the trade of firearms with Europeans did play a role in shaping power dynamics and conflicts within Africa during this period.\n\nOption C suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves. This option aligns with the historical reality of the transatlantic slave trade, where European merchants were heavily involved in the capture and sale of African slaves.\n\nOption D proposes that Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty. While there were instances of alliances between Africans and Europeans against common enemies, such as rival African groups or external threats, this option does not directly address the broader dynamics of trading contacts between Sub-Saharan Africans and Europeans during this period.\n\nConsidering the historical context provided by Walter Rodney's perspective on European imperialism in Africa, the most relevant option that aligns with the negative impact of European involvement in Africa's development would be Option C.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.

A diamond rush ensued following the discovery of diamonds on Zulu lands.\n\nThe information provided in the passage mentions that the British citizen had a farm of 50 acres close to the town, which implies that there was a significant European presence in the area. The discovery of diamonds on Zulu lands would have attracted European settlers looking to capitalize on the economic opportunities presented by the diamond rush. This aligns with the historical context of the time, as the discovery of valuable resources often led to increased migration and settlement by Europeans in various parts of Africa."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

Mao is advocating for the socialist transformation of agriculture through cooperation and the elimination of rich-peasant economies in order to address the growing polarization in the countryside and ensure that all rural people become increasingly well off together. This aligns with the idea of collectivization to reduce inequality between different segments of the population."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?", "choices": ["How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other", "Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era", "Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.", "How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "The argument in the passage discusses the different approaches taken by Europe and China in developing gunpowder weaponry based on their specific military needs and threats.

Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n\nThe passage highlights how the development of gunpowder weaponry in Europe was driven by the need to address the challenges of protracted sieges, while China focused on improving horse archer units to combat steppe nomads. This difference in military strategy and technology development could be a contributing factor to why European states attained military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nEvery two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von Füch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nBoth passages are best seen in the context of which of the following broad developments?", "choices": ["Emerging systems of coerced labor", "The expansion of chattel slavery", "Increased reliance on prison-camp workforces", "Colonization of overseas territories by joint-stock companies"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "The passages provided describe instances of forced labor and tribute extraction imposed on indigenous populations by colonial powers. In the first passage, the Spanish colonial authorities in South America are described as sending indigenous people to work in mines under the mita system, which was a form of coerced labor. In the second passage, the Russian authorities are described as imposing tribute payments on the Yakut and Tungus natives in Siberia, leading to the depletion of natural resources and the impoverishment of the indigenous populations.\n\nGiven the focus on forced labor, tribute extraction, and the exploitation of indigenous populations by colonial powers, the passages are best seen in the context of emerging systems of coerced labor (Option A). This broader development reflects the historical trend of colonial powers using various forms of forced labor to extract resources and wealth from indigenous populations in different parts of the world."}
