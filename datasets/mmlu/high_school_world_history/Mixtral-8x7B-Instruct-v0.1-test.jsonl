{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?", "choices": ["They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.", "They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.", "They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.", "They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology."], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": " C. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\n\nThe passage states that China was mainly threatened by highly mobile steppe nomads during the 1300s. Early gunpowder weapons were unwieldy and not effective against such fast-moving enemies. Thus, the Chinese logically decided to improve their horse archer units, which were more suited to combat their primary threat. This decision, while strategically sound given their circumstances, meant that they did not prioritize the innovation of gunpowder weaponry."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H.

A tactic allowing the exclusion of non-Europeans without referring directly to race. This is because the law states that a person can be excluded if they fail to write out and sign a passage of fifty words in a European language directed by the officer. This requirement is more likely to be challenging for non-European immigrants, thereby providing a way to restrict their entry into the country without explicitly mentioning race."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?", "choices": ["The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India", "British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company", "Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority", "The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government"], "answer": 3, "model_answer": 3, "completion": " Based on the information provided, the correct answer is D. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government.\n\nThe passages describe the Cawnpore massacres during the Revolt of 1857 in India, which was a significant uprising against British rule. The first passage, written by British journalist William Howard Russell, highlights the shock and horror felt by the British at the violence committed by Indian rebels against British men, women, and children. The second passage, written by historian Rudrangshu Mukherjee, provides additional context for the revolt, explaining that it was a response to the British monopoly on violence and their treatment of Indians as inferior.\n\nHowever, both passages make it clear that the British ultimately defeated the Indian rebels. The first passage notes that the leaders of the revolt sought to destroy every white person they encountered, indicating a level of violence and aggression that was met with British military force. The second passage explains that the British monopoly on violence was shattered by the indigenous violence of the colonized, but it does not suggest that the rebels were successful in their uprising.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the short-term outcome of the events discussed in the passages was the defeat of the Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government. This is consistent with historical records, which show that the British were able to suppress the revolt and consolidate their control over India, leading to the end of the British East India Company's rule and the beginning of direct British rule."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties.

Ulrich Zwingli\n\nUlrich Zwingli, like Martin Luther, was a leader in the Protestant Reformation and held similar views regarding the need for reform in the Christian Church. Zwingli, a Swiss theologian, was particularly critical of the Roman Catholic Church's corruption, wealth, and abuse of power, which he believed hindered the spiritual well-being of the faithful. In his own context, Zwingli advocated for the removal of religious images from churches, promoted the use of vernacular languages in worship, and supported the idea of married clergy. These views align with the criticisms of the Church expressed by Luther in his letter, making option A the correct answer.\n\nOption B, Sir Thomas More, was a Catholic English statesman and philosopher who opposed the Protestant Reformation and was ultimately executed for his beliefs. He is not known for expressing views similar to those of Luther.\n\nOption C, Erasmus, was a Dutch Renaissance humanist, Catholic priest, and theologian who is often considered a forerunner of the Protestant Reformation. While he was critical of the Church's corruption and called for reform, his approach was more moderate than that of Luther and Zwingli. Erasmus did not advocate for a complete break with the Catholic Church, as Luther and Zwingli did.\n\nOption D, John Wycliffe, was an English theologian, philosopher, and early advocate of reform in the Catholic Church. He is often considered a precursor to the Protestant Reformation. Wycliffe's views on the Church's corruption and the need for reform were influential, but his criticisms were not as direct and forceful as those expressed by Luther in the letter provided."}

Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians.

At first, there were plenty of furbearing animals in their lands, but over time, the numbers of these animals significantly decreased, making it difficult for the natives to fulfill their tribute obligations. The passage also mentions that almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.

On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

He argues that the only solution to this problem is to bring about the socialist transformation of agriculture, which involves the gradual elimination of the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside. This is a clear reference to the policy of collectivization, where individual landholdings are merged into collective farms owned and managed by the peasants themselves.\n\nThis policy is aimed at reducing inequality between different sectors of the population by ensuring that all rural people will become increasingly well-off together. This is in contrast to the capitalist system, where the rich tend to get richer while the poor get poorer. Therefore, Mao's quotation is best understood in the context of governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals.
