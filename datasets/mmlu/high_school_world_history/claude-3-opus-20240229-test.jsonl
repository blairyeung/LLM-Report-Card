{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?", "choices": ["They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.", "They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.", "They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.", "They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology."], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "Based on the information provided in the passage, the best answer is C: They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\n\nThe passage explains that during the 1200s to 1400s, Western Europe found early cannons useful in sieges, even though they were heavy and slow to fire. This led European governments to invest in further development of gunpowder weapons.\n\nIn contrast, China during this period was mainly threatened by highly mobile steppe nomads. The early gunpowder weapons, being unwieldy, were of little use against these mobile enemies. Therefore, China focused its efforts on improving horse archer units, which could more effectively combat the nomads.\n\nThe passage suggests that China made a logical decision based on its specific military needs at the time, rather than the other factors mentioned in the answer choices (Confucian traditionalism, overconfidence in numerical strength, or inability to afford new technology)."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"After the Tencteri came, in former days, the Bructeri; but the general account now is, that the Chamavi and Angrivarii entered their settlements, drove them out and utterly exterminated them with the common help of the [neighboring] tribes, either from hatred of their tyranny, or from the attractions of plunder, or from heaven's [favorable] regard for us. It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes.

The excerpt expresses delight at the conflict and destruction among the Germanic tribes. It sees their fighting and killing each other as a \"spectacle\" and a \"boon\" granted by fortune. This suggests a disdainful and condescending view of these tribes, seeing their discord and suffering as entertaining and beneficial to Rome.\n\n2. While the passage mentions the extermination of the Bructeri tribe, there is no explicit concern expressed about barbarian attacks on Rome itself. The focus is more on the tribes fighting each other.\n\n3. Stoicism, a philosophy emphasizing endurance, self-control and reason, is not directly relevant to the sentiments expressed in the excerpt. The passage does not provide evidence for the presence or absence of Stoic thought among Roman aristocracy.\n\n4. The excerpt does not discuss the size or maintenance of Roman armies.\n\nConsidering the options, A (Disgust for barbarian peoples) seems to best fit the tone and message of the excerpt. The author expresses a view of the Germanic tribes as inferior, taking pleasure in their suffering and wishing for continued discord among them for Rome's benefit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer appears to be A. The views in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of disgust for barbarian peoples in Roman society."}

The Act specifically targets \"Chinese laborers\" coming to the United States, seeing them as a threat to \"good order\" in certain areas.\n\n2. It makes it illegal for Chinese laborers to enter the country after 90 days from the Act's passage, and for those who do come, to remain in the United States.\n\n3. It imposes penalties on ship masters who knowingly bring Chinese laborers to the United States.\n\nAmong the answer choices, railroad construction stands out as the most likely driver of Chinese immigration in this period. Some key historical context:\n\n- In the mid-late 1800s, there was massive railroad construction across the western United States, including the First Transcontinental Railroad completed in 1869.\n\n- Many thousands of Chinese laborers were recruited to work on these railroad projects. They often did dangerous work like blasting tunnels through mountains.\n\n- The completion of the railroads led to many Chinese workers seeking other work in the U.S., often in competition with white laborers. This fueled anti-Chinese sentiment.\n\nThe other choices - fertilizer harvesting, sugarcane production, and gold mining - while industries that did employ some Chinese labor, were not as significant drivers of mass immigration as railroad construction in the years leading up to the 1882 Act.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A. Railroad construction was the economic activity that most drove the rising levels of Chinese immigration that led to the enactment of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882."}

Long-distance contact between civilizations stagnated.\nThe passage suggests the opposite. Ibn Battuta, a Muslim traveler, visits China and encounters people of various religions, including Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks. This indicates that long-distance contact and travel were occurring during this period.\n\nB. New religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs.\nThe passage does not provide evidence to support this. While it mentions the presence of different religious groups in China, it does not suggest that new religions were overturning existing beliefs.\n\nC. The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia.\nThe passage provides some support for this conclusion. It mentions that the King of China is a Tartar and a descendant of Genghis Khan, suggesting the influence of steppe nomads in China. The presence of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks in China also implies trade links across Eurasia.\n\nD. Technological developments spread across trade routes.\nWhile this may have been true during the period, the passage does not provide direct evidence to support this conclusion.\n\nBased on the information in the passage, option C, \"The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia,\" is the conclusion most directly supported.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.\nFirstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…\n…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures?

The first wall mentioned is that if pressed by the temporal power, they affirm that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them and that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\n\nThis suggests a contrast between the temporal power, which seems to represent a worldly or secular authority, and the spiritual power of the Church. The word \"temporal\" itself refers to earthly life or material matters, as opposed to spiritual or heavenly concerns.\n\nTherefore, the passage is most likely referring to the authority of the state or secular rulers when it mentions the \"temporal power,\" as distinct from the spiritual authority claimed by the Church."}

The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year….\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

The author, Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, points out several abuses, such as:\n\n1. Indians being tortured and dying in the mines.\n2. Mine owners and stewards acting as tyrants without fear of God or justice.\n3. Indians not being paid for their labor and being forced to work in non-mining tasks.\n4. Indians being forced into debt by having to accept goods at their own expense.\n\nImportantly, the author states that there is \"no remedy for all this\" because colonial officials are bribed by mine owners, and even the \"protector of the Indians\" fails to warn the King or the royal court about the harm done to the Native Americans.\n\nThis suggests that the King is either unaware or unconcerned about the welfare of his Native American subjects, as the abuses continue without intervention from the Crown. The passage does not provide evidence for the other options, such as debt slavery, lack of corruption among elites, or social stratification based on birth origin."}

The passage does not mention educational standards or societal growth. It focuses on restrictions, making this an unlikely interpretation.\n\nB. The requirement to write a passage in a European language, coupled with the historical context of the White Australia policy, strongly suggests that this language requirement was a tactic to exclude non-Europeans without explicitly mentioning race.\n\nC. The passage does mention exemptions for workmen with special skills, but this is a separate clause from the language requirement. The language test seems to be a general requirement, not one tied to ensuring expertise.\n\nD. While the Act places restrictions on immigration, it does not bar all immigrants. Certain groups like skilled workmen could be exempted, contradicting the idea of a total bar.\n\nConsidering these points, option B appears to be the safest interpretation. The language requirement allowed the exclusion of non-Europeans through an ostensibly neutral test, without overtly referring to race, which would have been more controversial. This interpretation is supported by the historical context and the similarities with the explicitly race-based Chinese Exclusion Act mentioned in the second passage."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?", "choices": ["The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India", "British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company", "Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority", "The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government"], "answer": 3, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information given and consider the historical context.\n\nKey points from the passages:\n1.

He believed that governments could and should take active steps to stimulate the economy and maintain consumer demand during recessions or depressions.\n\nIn the context of Bismarck's remarks about the insecurity and vulnerability of workers, Keynes would likely see this as a situation where government intervention could help. By providing assistance to workers who fall into poverty due to illness, age, or lack of work, the government could help maintain consumer spending and prevent a downward economic spiral.\n\nKeynes would be unlikely to suggest limited help only for the elderly (option B) or caution against government intervention (option C), as these go against his general belief in the importance of government involvement in the economy.

By limiting the duration of their stay, requiring them to register their names, and not allowing them to reside within the city, the Ming government was effectively limiting contact between foreigners and the local population. Additionally, these measures would have made it easier for the government to keep track of the traders' activities and collect any applicable taxes or duties.\n\nThe other options are not as strongly supported by the passage. The strict regulations do not imply a welcoming attitude towards commercial enterprise (A). The passage does not mention piracy (C) or any specific limitations on the number of Portuguese boats allowed to trade annually (D)."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

The development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China.\n- This might not directly undermine the worker-peasant alliance, as it doesn't specifically address rural conditions or the relationship between workers and peasants.\n\nB. Political friction with the Soviet Union pushed China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War.\n- Foreign policy shifts also don't seem to directly impact the domestic worker-peasant alliance that Mao is focused on.\n\nC. The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry.\n- If the policies meant to make \"all the rural people\" become \"increasingly well off together\" instead resulted in widespread famine and poverty among the peasantry, this would directly contradict Mao's stated goals and likely strain the worker-peasant alliance.\n\nD. Opposition voices in the Communist Party led by men such as Deng Xiaopeng were rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution.\n- While this represents political turmoil, it doesn't clearly connect to the economic conditions and class relations in the countryside that Mao is discussing.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to most directly and strongly undermine the hopes Mao expresses in the passage.

The poem mentions soldiers being constantly sent to the frontier garrisons, even from a young age of 15 up to 40. This suggests ongoing military campaigns and a need to maintain a strong military presence.\n\n2. The line \"The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean, But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest\" directly references the emperor's expansionist policies and the heavy toll in bloodshed it requires.\n\n3.

He opposed the Protestant Reformation and defended the Catholic Church's teachings and practices.\n\nC. Erasmus: Erasmus was a Dutch humanist who, while remaining within the Catholic Church, criticized its excesses and called for reform. However, he did not go as far as Luther in his critique of the Church's hierarchy and authority.\n\nD. John Wycliffe: Wycliffe was an English theologian who, like Luther, criticized the wealth and power of the Church. He argued for the authority of the Bible over the Church and opposed the Pope's authority.\n\nBased on this analysis, the reformer who expressed views most similar to those of Martin Luther is John Wycliffe (D).

Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals: The passage clearly states that the once-plentiful furbearing animals, particularly sables and foxes, have been largely depleted in the region.

While the Columbian Exchange did introduce New World crops to Africa, there's little evidence that Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through food imports during this period.\n\nB: This has some merit. The introduction of European firearms did contribute to state consolidation and the rise of powerful kingdoms in Sub-Saharan Africa, such as the Asante. Trading with Europeans for guns was an important factor.\n\nC: This is not accurate. While the Atlantic slave trade expanded greatly during this period, with Europeans as major purchasers, they were not the sole buyers. The Arab slave trade across the Sahara and Indian Ocean also continued. Sub-Saharan Africans were not solely dependent on European slave traders.\n\nD: There is little historical evidence to support this claim. Most Sub-Saharan African states did not ally with Europeans to evict Muslim/Arab merchants or combat threats to their sovereignty during this time.\n\nBased on this analysis, B appears to be the best answer. The importance of trading contacts with Europeans in enabling Sub-Saharan Africans to consolidate states and build powerful kingdoms through the acquisition of firearms is well-supported by historical evidence from this period."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.

This implies that these advancements eventually led to Europe's military superiority.\n\nIn contrast, China faced different threats from nomadic tribes and found early gunpowder weapons less effective. As a result, they focused on improving cavalry units instead. This difference in military priorities and investment likely contributed to the divergence in military capabilities between Europe and China in the modern era.\n\nThe other choices are less directly related to the main argument:\n\nA. The passage does not discuss societies sharing technologies with each other.\nC. The passage does not mention the Silk Road or its decline.\nD. The passage does not discuss the medieval climatic optimum or cultural diffusion.\n\nTherefore, choice B is the most fitting answer to the question posed."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nEvery two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von Füch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nBoth passages are best seen in the context of which of the following broad developments?", "choices": ["Emerging systems of coerced labor", "The expansion of chattel slavery", "Increased reliance on prison-camp workforces", "Colonization of overseas territories by joint-stock companies"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To determine which broad development both passages are best seen in the context of, let's analyze each passage:\n\n1. The first passage by Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa describes the harsh working conditions of indigenous people (Indians) in mercury mines in Peru under Spanish colonial rule. The Indians are forced to work in the mines under a system called \"mita\" and are paid low wages.\n\n2. The second passage by Heinrich von Füch discusses the detrimental effects of the \"yasak\" tribute system on the Yakut and Tungus natives in Northeast Siberia under Russian control. The natives are forced to pay tribute in furs or cash, leading to the depletion of fur-bearing animals and the impoverishment of the native population.\n\nBoth passages describe systems where indigenous populations are coerced into labor or paying tribute under colonial rule, resulting in their exploitation and impoverishment.\n\nConsidering the given options:\n\nA. Emerging systems of coerced labor - This option fits both passages well, as they describe the mita and yasak systems, which are forms of coerced labor under colonial rule.\nB. The expansion of chattel slavery - While the passages describe exploitative labor practices, they do not specifically mention chattel slavery.\nC. Increased reliance on prison-camp workforces - The passages do not mention prison camps or the use of prison labor.\nD. Colonization of overseas territories by joint-stock companies - Although the passages are set in the context of colonization, they do not specifically mention joint-stock companies.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A. Emerging systems of coerced labor. Both the mita system in Spanish colonial Peru and the yasak tribute system in Russian-controlled Northeast Siberia are examples of coerced labor systems that emerged during the colonial era."}

The phrase \"some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only\" implies a certain skepticism or cynicism about the extreme positions people took regarding the revolution.\n\nWordsworth's perspective:\nIn contrast, Wordsworth's lines express a much more positive and enthusiastic view of the French Revolution. The phrase \"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive\" conveys a sense of joy and excitement about the revolutionary period. \"But to be young was very heaven\" further emphasizes the poet's enthusiasm, particularly from the perspective of youth.\n\nGiven these analyses, the best answer choice is C: Cynical, enthusiastic. Dickens's perspective can be described as cynical or skeptical, while Wordsworth's view is clearly enthusiastic and optimistic about the French Revolution."}

Military campaigns (A): The passage does not mention any military campaigns or their influence on the economic system.\n\n2. Meteorological phenomena (B): The passage mentions that Aden has no water sources and relies on rainwater collected in reservoirs. However, this fact alone does not directly lead to the development of the described economic system.\n\n3. Competition with European trade networks (C): The passage does not mention any European trade networks or competition with them during the given time period (ca. 1325–1354 C.E.).\n\n4. The presence of highly developed port cities (D): The passage clearly states that Aden is a port city that attracts large vessels from various Indian ports, such as Cambay, Quilon, and Calicut. It also mentions the presence of Indian and Egyptian merchants living in Aden, and that the inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some merchants are described as immensely rich, owning large ships and their contents.\n\nBased on the information provided, the presence of highly developed port cities (D) seems to be the factor that directly led to the development of the economic system described in Ibn Battuta's journal. The port city of Aden and its connection to other major Indian ports facilitated trade, attracting merchants and fostering a thriving economy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: The presence of highly developed port cities."}
