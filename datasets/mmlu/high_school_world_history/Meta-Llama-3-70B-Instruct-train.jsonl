The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants: This development would actually enhance the trade patterns mentioned, as the Chinese would have more goods to purchase from European merchants.\n\nB. Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas: These revolutions were primarily focused on political and social changes, and did not directly impact the trade patterns mentioned.\n\nC. The Industrial Revolution: This revolution transformed the way goods were produced and transported, making it possible for European powers to produce goods more cheaply and efficiently. This could have disrupted the trade patterns mentioned, as European powers may have been able to produce goods that were previously only available in China, reducing their need to trade with China. However, it's not a direct undoing of the trade patterns.\n\nD. The colonization of Africa: This development is not directly related to the trade patterns mentioned, as Africa was not a significant player in the China-Japan-India trade network described.\n\nHowever, there is another factor to consider: the Opium Wars (1839-1842, 1856-1860) and the subsequent forced opening of Chinese ports to European trade. This event, which occurred during the period 1750-1900 C.E., directly undid the trade patterns mentioned by allowing European powers to trade directly with China and bypassing the Portuguese monopoly. The Opium Wars also led to the imposition of unequal treaties, which forced China to open up its markets to European goods and capital.\n\nWhile none of the answer choices directly mention the Opium Wars, the Industrial Revolution (C) is the closest to being a correct answer, as it laid the groundwork for European powers to challenge the Portuguese monopoly and eventually force open Chinese ports to European trade."}

This suggests that he values African autonomy and self-determination.\n* He criticizes the Great Powers for their disregard of African independence, implying that Africa should be free from external influence and control.\n* He does not mention any specific economic or social systems, such as communism or socialism, as the solution to Africa's problems.\n* He does not advocate for the continuation of colonial or imperial relationships, which would be characteristic of neocolonialism.\n\nBased on these points, Nkrumah's argument most clearly supports Pan-Africanism, which emphasizes the unity and solidarity of African peoples and the promotion of their common interests. Pan-Africanism often involves a desire for African autonomy and self-determination, as well as a critique of external influence and control.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Pan-Africanism."}

It emphasizes the importance of industriousness, correct behavior, and ancestral worship for women. The passage suggests that women's roles were largely confined to domestic duties, serving their husbands, and maintaining family traditions.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\nA. Women were increasingly thought of as primary earners for the family.\nThis option is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that women were expected to be primary earners. Instead, it focuses on their domestic duties and responsibilities within the household.\n\nB. Women were increasingly responsible for the care of their children.\nThis option is partially correct. While the passage does not explicitly mention childcare, it implies that women were responsible for managing the household and performing domestic duties, which likely included caring for children. However, this is not the primary restriction mentioned in the passage.\n\nC. Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere.\nThis option is correct. The passage suggests that women's roles and responsibilities were largely confined to the private sphere of the household, where they were expected to manage domestic duties, serve their husbands, and maintain family traditions. This implies that women's power and influence were limited to the private sphere, with little opportunity for public participation or recognition.\n\nD. Women's power increasingly fell within the public sphere.\nThis option is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that women's power or influence extended to the public sphere. Instead, it reinforces the idea that women's roles were largely confined to the private sphere.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is C. Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere."}

It highlights Sanehat's military prowess, conquests, and the ruler's admiration for him. The passage also mentions a champion from Syria who challenges Sanehat to a fight.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Meritocratic appointments by rulers to their bureaucracies: The passage suggests that the Syrian ruler appointed Sanehat as the commander of his army based on his military skills and achievements. This implies that the ruler valued merit and competence in his appointments, which supports option A.\n\nB. Long-distance contact between Egypt and other lands: Although the passage mentions Syria, it does not provide direct evidence of long-distance contact between Egypt and other lands. The focus is on Sanehat's military campaigns and his relationship with the Syrian ruler, rather than on trade or cultural exchange between Egypt and Syria. Therefore, option B is not strongly supported by the passage.\n\nC. The clan as the basic political unit: There is no mention of clans or kinship groups playing a significant role in the passage. The focus is on the individual, Sanehat, and his relationship with the Syrian ruler, rather than on clan-based politics. Therefore, option C is not supported by the passage.\n\nD. A lack of emphasis on martial ability: The passage is filled with descriptions of Sanehat's military conquests, bravery, and martial skills. The Syrian ruler's admiration for Sanehat is based on his military prowess, which suggests that martial ability was highly valued in this society. Therefore, option D is not supported by the passage.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is A. Meritocratic appointments by rulers to their bureaucracies. The passage provides evidence that the Syrian ruler appointed Sanehat based on his military skills and achievements, which suggests a meritocratic approach to appointments."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nQuestions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.\nThe Slave Trade\nAll of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for \"black Africans\"]. . . .

All of you [soldiers], are summoned... to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nThe passage describes the Arab slave trade caravan's activities, including attacking villages, seizing people, and buying and selling slaves. However, only one statement explicitly mentions religion: the phrase \"idolatrous Koholanes.\" The word \"idolatrous\" implies that the Koholanes are being targeted because of their religious beliefs, which are considered inferior or false by the Arab slave traders. This statement suggests that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade, as the Koholanes were being hunted and enslaved specifically because of their religious beliefs.\n\nThe other options do not provide direct evidence of religion playing a role in the Arab slave trade:\n\nA. Seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields is a description of the slave traders' actions, but it does not mention religion.\n\nB. With orders to attack places without defenses is also a description of the slave traders' actions, but it does not imply a religious motivation.\n\nC.

The tone is one of unity and cooperation among Asian and African nations.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\nA. The formation of the non-aligned movement: This option seems plausible, as the passage talks about Asian and African nations coming together to promote peace and stability. The non-aligned movement was a group of countries that didn't align themselves with any major power bloc during the Cold War, and it was formed in the 1950s and 1960s. The passage's emphasis on collective action and peace aligns with the principles of the non-aligned movement.\n\nB. Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation: While the passage does mention peace, it doesn't specifically focus on disarmament or nuclear non-proliferation. The tone is more about promoting peace and stability through collective action, rather than addressing specific arms control issues.\n\nC. The Green Revolution in agriculture: This option seems unrelated to the passage, which doesn't mention agriculture or any scientific/technological advancements.\n\nD. Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology: This option is close, but not entirely accurate. The passage does emphasize Asian and African unity, but it's more focused on promoting peace and stability rather than a specific ideology.\n\nBased on the analysis, I would conclude that the correct answer is:\n\nA. The formation of the non-aligned movement"}

This suggests that Islam prohibits these activities and encourages believers to abstain from them.\n\nThe second verse from the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, on the other hand, celebrates the joy of wine and seems to promote its consumption. Omar Khayyám was a Persian poet and mathematician who lived in the 11th-12th centuries, and his work is considered a classic of Persian literature.\n\nGiven these two verses, we can infer that:\n\n* The Qur'an represents the orthodox Islamic view, which prohibits wine consumption.\n* The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, written by a Muslim poet, seems to contradict this view by promoting wine consumption.\n\nThis contrast suggests that not all Muslims adhered strictly to the religious restrictions outlined in the Qur'an. Therefore, the most supported conclusion is:\n\nB. Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims.\n\nThis conclusion is reasonable because it acknowledges the diversity of practices and beliefs within the Muslim community, even among intellectuals and poets like Omar Khayyám."}

The rise of anti-Semitic ideologies: There is no mention of anti-Semitism or Jews in either passage, so this option is not relevant.\n\nB. Trade protectionism: While the Australian act does mention manual labor, it's not primarily about protecting domestic industries or trade. The focus is on restricting immigration.\n\nC. A growing desire to attract skilled labor from abroad: Actually, the opposite is true. The Australian act restricts immigration of certain types of laborers, and the Chinese Exclusion Act explicitly excludes Chinese laborers.\n\nD. Hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment: This option is the most fitting. Both passages demonstrate a restrictive approach to immigration, with the Australian act setting language and skill requirements and the Chinese Exclusion Act targeting a specific ethnic group.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": ["Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown", "Killing of civilians during wartime", "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction", "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To determine which form of violence the passages are best connected with, let's analyze the content of the passages.\n\nThe first passage by William Howard Russell describes the Cawnpore massacres during the Indian Mutiny of 1857, where Indian rebels killed British civilians, including women and children. The passage highlights the shock and outrage caused by the fact that the perpetrators were \"black men\" who dared to shed the blood of their \"masters.\"\n\nThe second passage by Rudrangshu Mukherjee provides a more theoretical and historical context to the violence. It argues that the British rule in India was based on a monopoly of violence, which was shattered by the indigenous violence of the colonized during the revolt of 1857. The passage emphasizes the hierarchical arrangement of superior and inferior races, with the British treating Indians as inferior and denying them \"humanness.\"\n\nConsidering the content of both passages, it is clear that the form of violence being described is not banditry due to socio-economic breakdown (A), nor is it collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction (C). The violence is not a random or accidental consequence of war, but rather a deliberate and targeted attack on civilians, particularly those of a certain race or nationality.\n\nThe correct answer is B. Killing of civilians during wartime, as the passages describe the intentional killing of British civilians, including women and children, during the Indian Mutiny of 1857.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the passages also touch on the theme of genocide, as the British rule in India was based on a denial of \"humanness\" to Indians and a hierarchical arrangement of superior and inferior races. Therefore, while the primary form of violence described is the killing of civilians during wartime, there are also undertones of state-sponsored campaigns of genocide (D)."}

Specifically, it expects women to:\n\n* Retire late and rise early to perform domestic duties (industrious nature)\n* Be correct in manner and upright in character to serve their husbands (character)\n* Live in purity and quietness of spirit, attend to their own affairs, and avoid gossip and silly laughter (character)\n* Cleanse, purify, and arrange offerings to ancestors (ancestral worship)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA. That they obediently fulfill their obligations within the home: This expectation is indeed expressed in the passage, as women are expected to perform domestic duties, serve their husbands, and attend to their own affairs.\n\nB. That they collaborate with their husbands on domestic tasks: There is no mention of collaboration or shared responsibilities with husbands in the passage.\n\nC. That they pursue education in order to find meaningful employment: Education and employment are not mentioned at all in the passage.\n\nD.

She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness.

You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism.

Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?", "choices": ["Tang and Ottoman", "Ming and Aztec", "Han and Gupta", "Qin and Etruscan"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "Let's break down the reasons given in the passage for the fall of the Roman Empire:\n\n1. Immoderate greatness leading to decay\n2. Corruption of military discipline\n3. Victorious legions becoming oppressive and mercenary-like\n4. Emperors prioritizing personal safety over the empire's well-being\n5. Influx of barbarians overwhelming the empire\n\nConsidering these reasons, we can look for other classical empires that may have experienced similar factors contributing to their decline.\n\nThe correct answer is C. Han and Gupta.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The Han Dynasty of China (206 BCE - 220 CE) experienced a similar decline due to internal corruption, military stagnation, and external pressures from nomadic tribes. The Han Empire's vast territorial expansion and prosperity led to internal decay, and its military discipline was compromised by eunuchs and corrupt officials.\n* The Gupta Empire of India (320 - 550 CE) also faced similar challenges. Its extensive territorial reach and prosperity led to internal weaknesses, and its military was eventually overrun by external invaders, including the Huns.\n\nWhile the other options may have experienced some similar factors, they don't align as closely with the specific reasons mentioned in the passage:\n\n* A. Tang and Ottoman: The Tang Dynasty of China (618 - 907 CE) was known for its military strength and territorial expansion, but its decline was more related to internal power struggles and economic issues. The Ottoman Empire (1299 - 1922 CE) was a medieval and early modern empire that faced different challenges, such as the rise of European powers and internal strife.\n* B. Ming and Aztec: The Ming Dynasty of China (1368 - 1644 CE) experienced a decline due to internal strife, corruption, and external pressures from the Manchu people. The Aztec Empire (1325 - 1521 CE) was a pre-Columbian empire that was conquered by the Spanish, making its decline more related to external factors rather than internal decay.\n* D. Qin and Etruscan: The Qin Dynasty of China (221 - 206 BCE) was a short-lived empire that was overthrown by the Han Dynasty. The Etruscan civilization (8th - 1st centuries BCE) was a pre-Roman civilization in Italy that was eventually absorbed into the Roman Empire, making it difficult to apply the same reasons for decline."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Al-Zawawi also said 'This sultan Musa told me that at a town called ZKRY he has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. \"There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in. Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P. Hopkins, eds. Corpus of Early\nArabic Sources for West African History. Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1981. Reprinted with permission of\nCambridge University Press.\nAl' Umari, ca. 1300–1384\nBased on your knowledge of world history and the passage, Mansa Musa's assertion about the lack of duties levied on goods in his kingdom most strongly reflects which of the following about the kingdom of Mali?", "choices": ["Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals.", "Mali's wealth came in large part from its conquest of pagan neighbors.", "Mali's wealth came in large part from large agricultural estates.", "Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "Let's break down the passage and analyze the information provided.\n\nThe passage mentions that Sultan Musa (Mansa Musa) has a copper mine in a town called ZKRY, and the copper is brought to BYTY. The significant point here is that duty is collected only on this crude copper, and nothing else. This implies that the copper trade is a crucial aspect of the kingdom's economy.\n\nFurthermore, the passage states that the copper is sold to the pagan Sudan for two-thirds of its weight in gold. This suggests that the kingdom of Mali has a significant trade relationship with its neighbors, and copper is a valuable commodity in this trade.\n\nNow, let's examine the answer choices:\n\nA. Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals.\nThis option is supported by the passage, which highlights the importance of the copper mine and the trade of copper for gold. The fact that duty is collected only on copper suggests that it is a vital source of revenue for the kingdom.\n\nB. Mali's wealth came in large part from its conquest of pagan neighbors.\nThere is no evidence in the passage to support this claim. While the passage does mention trade with pagan nations, there is no indication that Mali's wealth comes from conquest.\n\nC. Mali's wealth came in large part from large agricultural estates.\nThere is no mention of agriculture or large estates in the passage, so this option is not supported.\n\nD. Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade.\nAgain, there is no evidence in the passage to support this claim. While the passage does mention pagan nations, it does not imply that they are involved in the slave trade or that Mali's wealth comes from this source.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"When the gods fashioned Gilgamesh*, to him they gave a perfect form.

The text describes Gilgamesh's divine origins, his accomplishments, and the city of Uruk.\n\nOption A suggests that the rise of a literate class of scribes in cities led to the development of epic poetry. This option is plausible, as the Epic of Gilgamesh was indeed written down by scribes. The text itself mentions the \"Seven Sages\" who laid the foundation of the temple of Ishtar, which could imply a group of learned individuals who contributed to the creation of the epic.\n\nOption B is less likely, as there is no indication in the text that a merchant class sponsored the creation of the Epic of Gilgamesh. The poem focuses on the king and the city, rather than trade or commerce.\n\nOption C is also unlikely, as the text does not suggest that a religious caste was solely dedicated to recording the deeds of God-Kings. While Gilgamesh is described as two-thirds god and one-third man, the poem is more focused on his accomplishments as a king and builder than on his divine nature.\n\nOption D is possible, as the Epic of Gilgamesh does praise the deeds of Gilgamesh, a warrior-king. However, the poem is more than just a praise of Gilgamesh's military prowess; it also describes his building projects, his relationship with the gods, and the city of Uruk.\n\nBased on the analysis, I would argue that Option A is the most plausible answer. The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities likely played a significant role in the development of epic poetry, including the Epic of Gilgamesh."}

The colonization of the interior of Africa: While this option involves the exploitation of a continent outside Western Europe, it's not a strong candidate because the colonization of Africa's interior didn't occur until the late 19th century, well outside the 1450-1750 C.E. time frame.\n\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire: This option is a good candidate because the conquest of the Aztec Empire by the Spanish in the early 16th century led to the exploitation of the New World's resources, including its ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets. This event contributed significantly to Western Europe's growth and helped establish its global dominance.\n\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity: This option is not relevant to the author's assertion, as it's a religious movement that didn't directly contribute to Western Europe's exploitation of external resources or its rise to global hegemony.\n\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan: This option is also not relevant, as it describes a policy of Japan's isolation from the rest of the world, which didn't contribute to Western Europe's growth or exploitation of external resources.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best option to support the author's assertion is:\n\nB.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.\nFirstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…\n…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only.

The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts.\n\nIn the passage, Martin Luther discusses the \"second wall\" as the Romanists' claim that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope. He argues that this is a weak and tottering wall because the Romanists assume authority over the Scriptures without actually learning from them, and they claim that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, even though they cannot prove it with Scripture. This indicates that the \"second wall\" refers to the differing views on the interpretation and use of biblical texts, with the Romanists claiming exclusive authority and the Reformers, like Luther, arguing for a more individual and scripturally-based approach."}
