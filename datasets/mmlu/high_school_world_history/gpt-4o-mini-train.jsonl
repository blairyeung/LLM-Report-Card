{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": ["Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown", "Killing of civilians during wartime", "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction", "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To determine which form of violence the passages best connect with, we need to analyze the content and context of both excerpts.\n\nThe first passage by William Howard Russell discusses the Cawnpore massacres during the Indian Mutiny of 1857, emphasizing the targeted killing of British individuals (men, women, and children) by Indian rebels. This indicates a deliberate act of violence against civilians based on their race and status as colonizers.\n\nThe second passage by Rudrangshu Mukherjee elaborates on the nature of violence in the context of British colonial rule, highlighting the monopoly of violence held by the British and the indigenous response to that violence. It discusses the hierarchical relationship between the British and Indians, where the British viewed themselves as superior and the Indians as inferior. The revolt is framed as a reaction to this oppression, leading to violence against the British.\n\nGiven this analysis, the violence described in both passages is characterized by the intentional targeting of civilians (British individuals) during a conflict (the revolt), which aligns with the definition of \"killing of civilians during wartime.\" \n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown - This does not fit as the violence is not described as banditry or a result of socio-economic issues.\n\nB. Killing of civilians during wartime - This aligns well with the targeted killings of British civilians during the revolt.\n\nC. Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction - This is not relevant to the context of the passages.\n\nD.

No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness.

You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBut the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?", "choices": ["Tang and Ottoman", "Ming and Aztec", "Han and Gupta", "Qin and Etruscan"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "To determine which classical empires the reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire could also apply to, we need to analyze the key themes presented in the passage. The passage discusses the decline as a result of:\n\n1. **Immoderate greatness** leading to decay.\n2. **Prosperity** that brings about internal weaknesses.\n3. **Military corruption** and the loss of discipline.\n4. **External pressures** from invading forces (Barbarians).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **Tang and Ottoman**: Both empires experienced periods of great prosperity and eventual decline due to internal strife and external pressures. However, the specific dynamics of their decline differ significantly from those of Rome.\n\nB. **Ming and Aztec**: The Ming faced internal corruption and external threats, while the Aztec Empire fell primarily due to conquest by the Spanish, which doesn't align closely with the themes of internal decay and military corruption.\n\nC. **Han and Gupta**: The Han Dynasty experienced a decline due to internal corruption, loss of central authority, and external invasions (similar to the Roman experience). The Gupta Empire also faced similar issues of internal strife and external invasions, leading to its decline.\n\nD. **Qin and Etruscan**: The Qin Dynasty was short-lived and did not experience a prolonged period of greatness like Rome. The Etruscans were eventually absorbed by Rome, so their decline does not parallel the themes of the passage.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best answer is **C. Han and Gupta**, as both empires experienced internal decay and external pressures that resonate with the reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Al-Zawawi also said 'This sultan Musa told me that at a town called ZKRY he has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. \"There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in. Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

This indicates that the kingdom's wealth is significantly tied to its mineral resources, particularly copper and gold. The mention of employing pagan nations to extract gold further emphasizes the importance of mineral exploitation in generating wealth.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals.** - This option aligns well with the passage, as it directly references the copper and gold mining activities that are central to the economy described.\n\nB. **Mali's wealth came in large part from its conquest of pagan neighbors.** - While conquest may have contributed to wealth, the passage does not emphasize this aspect. Instead, it focuses on mineral resources.\n\nC. **Mali's wealth came in large part from large agricultural estates.** - The passage does not mention agriculture as a source of wealth, making this option less relevant.\n\nD. **Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade.** - Although the slave trade was a component of many West African economies, the passage does not discuss this aspect, making it an unlikely choice.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate reflection of Mansa Musa's assertion about the lack of duties levied on goods in his kingdom is:\n\n**A. Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals.**"}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.\nFirstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…\n…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like.

However, the letter indicates that the author is seeking damages, which implies an expectation of government support rather than a severance of responsibility.\n\nD. **Liberate the Zulus from British colonialism** - This option is unlikely, as the context of the letter and the war itself was about British colonial expansion and control, not liberation.\n\nGiven the context of the letter and the ongoing conflict, the most plausible answer is **B.
