{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?", "choices": ["They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.", "They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.", "They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.", "They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology."], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "Based on the passage, the correct answer is C. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\n\nThe passage states that China was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, and early gunpowder weapons proved of little utility against them due to their unwieldiness. Therefore, China devoted its efforts to improving horse archer units, which were better suited to combat the country's deadliest foe. This suggests that the Chinese made a logical decision to focus on developing weapons that were more effective against their immediate military needs, rather than investing in gunpowder weaponry that was not well-suited for their specific circumstances."}

The Roman author seems to view the conflict as a means of maintaining order and stability, and even expresses a desire for the tribes to remain divided and hostile towards each other.\n\nThis passage can be seen as evidence of disgust for barbarian peoples in Roman society, as it portrays them as inferior and deserving of punishment.

Railroad construction.\n\nThe Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was enacted in response to concerns about the large number of Chinese immigrants coming to the United States, particularly during the California Gold Rush of the mid-19th century. Many of these immigrants came to work on the transcontinental railroad, which was being built at the time. The construction of the railroad required a large workforce, and many Chinese immigrants were attracted to the opportunity to work on the project.\n\nThe act was passed in part to address concerns about the impact of Chinese immigration on the American workforce and to reduce competition for jobs. The suspension of Chinese immigration and the penalties imposed on vessel masters who brought Chinese laborers to the United States were intended to reduce the number of Chinese immigrants coming to the country.\n\nWhile other economic activities, such as gold mining, may have also attracted Chinese immigrants, the construction of the transcontinental railroad was a major factor in the rising levels of immigration that led to the enactment of the Chinese Exclusion Act."}

This is supported by the fact that the Epic of Gilgamesh describes a dark and ominous afterlife, whereas the Maxims of Ptahhotep do not provide a clear picture of the afterlife. However, this conclusion is not strongly supported, as the Maxims do not explicitly describe the afterlife.\n* Option B: Ancient Egyptians were more inclined than ancient Sumerians to view political obedience as morally proper.

At that time, Senghor was a prominent figure in the Negritude movement, a cultural and literary movement that emerged in the 1930s and 1940s, primarily among French-speaking African intellectuals. The movement aimed to reclaim African cultural heritage and identity, and to challenge the dominant Western cultural norms.\n\nThe poem itself is a beautiful example of Senghor's lyrical style, which blends African imagery and symbolism with Western literary forms. The poem's language is rich and evocative, with vivid descriptions of New York City's landscape and its inhabitants. The speaker's use of metaphor, such as comparing the city's bridges to \"hips and supple vines,\" and the image of \"musk alligators\" and \"sea cows\" in the rivers, creates a sense of wonder and enchantment.\n\nConsidering the options, I think the most plausible explanation for an African poet writing so lyrically about New York is:\n\nB. Stronger transatlantic influences linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas\n\nThis option acknowledges the historical and cultural connections between Africa, Europe, and the Americas, which were shaped by the transatlantic slave trade, colonialism, and migration. The poem reflects the complex and dynamic exchange of ideas, cultures, and artistic forms that occurred across these regions. Senghor's poem is a testament to the ways in which African artists and intellectuals engaged with Western cultural influences, while also drawing upon their own cultural heritage and experiences.\n\nWhile options A and C are plausible, they don't fully capture the complexity of Senghor's poem and the cultural context in which it was written. Option D is less likely, as Senghor's poem is not a rejection of African cultural traditions, but rather an expression of the ways in which African artists and intellectuals engaged with and transformed Western cultural forms.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that option B, Stronger transatlantic influences linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas, best explains the phenomenon of an African poet writing so lyrically about New York."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?", "choices": ["The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India", "British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company", "Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority", "The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government"], "answer": 3, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "Based on the passages, I would argue that the correct answer is D. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government.\n\nThe passages describe the Cawnpore massacres as a brutal and violent event in which British civilians, including women and children, were killed by Indian rebels. The passages also highlight the racial and colonial dynamics at play, with the British viewing themselves as superior to the Indians and denying them \"humanness\". The British East India Company's monopoly on violence was shattered by the revolt, but the passages do not suggest that the Indians were able to achieve a military victory or gain independence.\n\nInstead, the passages suggest that the British responded to the revolt with force, and that the event ultimately led to the defeat of the Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government. The British journalist William Howard Russell's account of the event emphasizes the brutality and violence of the Indian rebels, while Rudrangshu Mukherjee's analysis highlights the ways in which the British used violence to maintain their dominance over India.\n\nTherefore, option D, the defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government, is the most likely outcome in the short term."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nEvery two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals.

The rural peasantry would have been disproportionately affected by this low literacy rate, as they would have had limited access to education and would have been more likely to be engaged in manual labor.\n2. Urban-rural divide: The Soviet Union was characterized by a significant urban-rural divide, with urban areas generally having better access to education and healthcare. The rural peasantry would have been more likely to be affected by the lack of educational opportunities, making them a priority group for literacy initiatives.\n3. Economic and social implications: Illiteracy would have had significant economic and social implications for the rural peasantry. They would have had limited access to information, making it difficult for them to make informed decisions about their livelihoods, and would have been more vulnerable to exploitation by landowners and other powerful groups.\n4.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre", "choices": ["was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.", "can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.", "should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.", "seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy."], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "Based on the second passage, I would choose option B: \"can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\"\n\nThe passage argues that the British had constructed a monopoly of violence in India, and that the revolt of 1857 shattered this monopoly by matching official, alien violence with indigenous violence of the colonized. It also states that the British treated Indians as animals, denying them \"humanness\" and conceiving of them as inferior. This suggests that the Cawnpore Massacre was a reaction to the systemic violence and oppression perpetrated by the British against the Indians.\n\nThe passage does not suggest that the massacre was justifiable according to local military custom (option A), nor does it praise it as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression (option C).

The Crusades.\n\nThe speech by Pope Urban II, recorded by Robert the Monk, is a call to arms for the First Crusade, which was a military campaign launched by Christian Europe to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim rule. The speech is a passionate appeal to the nobles and knights of Europe to take up the cross and march to Jerusalem to liberate the city from the \"unclean nations\" and to reclaim it for Christendom.\n\nThe speech mentions the invasion of Christian lands by the \"accursed race\" of the Persians, the destruction of churches, and the desecration of the Holy Sepulchre, which are all references to the Muslim conquest of the Middle East and the Byzantine Empire. The speech also invokes the glory of the Christian ancestors and the example of King Charles the Great and his son Louis, who had previously conquered the pagans and expanded the territory of the Holy Church.\n\nThe other options do not fit the context of the speech. The Mongol invasions of the Middle East occurred in the 13th century, long after the First Crusade. The Protestant Reformation did not occur until the 16th century, and the Age of Discovery was a period of European exploration and colonization that began in the 15th century."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"I travelled thence to 'Aden, the port of Yemen, on the coast of the ocean. It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325–1354 C.E.\nWhich of the following led directly to the development of the economic system described in the journal?", "choices": ["Military campaigns", "Meteorological phenomena", "Competition with European trade networks", "The presence of highly developed port cities"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "Based on the text, I would argue that the correct answer is D. The presence of highly developed port cities.\n\nThe text describes 'Aden as a major port city, surrounded by mountains and with no crops, trees, or water, but with reservoirs for collecting rainwater. It is the port of the Indians, and large vessels from various Malabar ports come to it. The city is inhabited by merchants, porters, and fishermen, and some merchants are immensely rich, owning large ships and their contents. This suggests that the city's economy is heavily reliant on trade, and the presence of highly developed port cities like 'Aden would have facilitated the development of a thriving trade network.\n\nThe other options do not seem to have a direct connection to the development of the economic system described in the journal. Military campaigns (A) might have had an impact on the city's economy, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the text. Meteorological phenomena (B) are not a factor in the development of the economic system, as the city's lack of crops, trees, and water is mitigated by the collection of rainwater. Competition with European trade networks (C) is not mentioned in the text, and it is unlikely that European trade networks would have had a significant impact on the city's economy at this time.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the presence of highly developed port cities (D) is the most likely factor that led directly to the development of the economic system described in the journal."}

Pan-Africanism. Here's my reasoning:\n\n* The speaker emphasizes the importance of unity among African states, suggesting that they are stronger together than they are apart.\n* The speaker notes that many African states are still struggling with the consequences of colonial rule, implying that they need to work together to overcome these challenges.\n* The speaker highlights the need for common purpose, planning, and endeavour among African states, which is a key principle of Pan-Africanism.\n* The speaker does not explicitly mention nationalism, socialism, or neocolonialism, which are not directly related to the idea of African unity and cooperation.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the correct answer is C.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Persians, an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation forsooth which has not directed its heart and has not entrusted its spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and fire; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion….The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months.

The Seljuk Turks, who were of Persian origin, had indeed invaded Anatolia in the late 11th century, and their conquests had led to the capture of several Christian cities and territories.\n\nThe other options do not provide a direct connection to the events described in the speech. Option A refers to the conquest of Constantinople by the Abbasid Caliphate, which occurred in the 7th century, long before the time of Urban's speech. Option C refers to the invasion of the Balkans by the Avars and Bulgars, which occurred in the 6th and 7th centuries, respectively, and is not directly related to the events described in the speech.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBy what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nOn which of the following arguments does the author of the passage principally base his appeal?", "choices": ["It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.", "Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral.", "Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade.", "Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "The author of the passage principally bases his appeal on argument A: \"It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.\"\n\nThe author argues that Britain prohibits opium in its own country, recognizing its harm to mankind, and therefore should not export it to China, especially not to the Inner Land.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nI have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n—Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nIn his letter, Martin Luther avoided speaking about which of the following topics?", "choices": ["The wealth of the church", "The power of the clergy", "The sale of indulgences", "The political nature of the church"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "Based on the provided text, the correct answer is C.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAlthough in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward.\n—Robert K.

Instead, the passage suggests that Peter the Great was determined to lead the transformation of Russia himself, using a combination of education, persuasion, and force (including physical punishment) to drive the country forward.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not among the options provided. However, it can be inferred that Peter the Great's reforms were likely to be more authoritarian and top-down, rather than based on the principles of popular sovereignty or individual rights."}
