{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?", "choices": ["They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.", "They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.", "They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.", "They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology."], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "To determine the most likely reason why the Chinese failed to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry, I will analyze each of the provided options:\n\nA.

This suggests that the rise in immigration may have been driven by the demand for labor in certain industries.\n\nThe second passage is the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 in the United States, which suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers. This act was passed in response to the perceived threat of Chinese laborers to the \"good order of certain localities\" within the United States.\n\nGiven this context, the most likely economic activity that drove the rising levels of immigration that led to the enactment of the Chinese Exclusion Act was:\n\nA. Railroad construction\n\nThe construction of railroads in the western United States in the late 19th century required a large labor force, and many Chinese immigrants were recruited to work on these projects. The influx of Chinese laborers, who were willing to work for lower wages, caused concern among native-born American workers and led to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act.\n\nThe other options (B. Fertilizer harvesting, C. Sugarcane production, and D. Gold mining) are less likely to have been the primary driver of the immigration that led to the Chinese Exclusion Act, as they are not as directly tied to the large-scale employment of Chinese laborers in the United States during this period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Railroad construction."}

They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures?

The first wall he mentions is the claim that \"the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\"\n\nGiven this context, the \"temporal power\" is best understood as referring to C. a state or secular authority, in contrast to the \"spiritual power\" of the Catholic Church.\n\nLuther is arguing that the Catholic Church has claimed that it is above the jurisdiction of secular or state authorities, and that only the spiritual authority of the Church has power over it. This was a common claim made by the Catholic Church at the time, as it sought to maintain its autonomy and authority separate from the secular rulers of Europe.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. a state or secular authority, as this best fits the contextual meaning of the \"temporal power\" in Luther's criticism of the Catholic Church's claims of ecclesiastical supremacy."}

Slavery was a common practice during the colonial era in the Americas.\n\nB) Indentured servitude: This does not seem to fit the context, as indentured servitude typically involved European immigrants agreeing to a period of labor in exchange for passage to the Americas. The quote is referring to the Spanish nobleman's control over the indigenous population.\n\nC) The encomienda system: This is likely the correct answer. The encomienda system was a labor system used by the Spanish Empire in the Americas, where the Spanish crown granted conquistadors or settlers the right to demand labor and tribute from the indigenous population living on the granted land. This fits the context of the Spanish nobleman having authority over \"his Indians\" and being able to compel them to provide food and agricultural products.\n\nD) The apprentice system: This does not seem to be the correct answer, as the apprentice system was more common in Europe and involved the training of young workers, rather than the control over indigenous labor.\n\nBased on the context provided in the quote, the economic practice referred to by the phrase \"his Indians\" is most likely the encomienda system, where the Spanish nobleman had authority and control over the indigenous population living on the land granted to him."}

His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n—Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

However, the passage also highlights the underlying tension and competition between the two nations.\n\nBonesteel knew that the Soviets were on the verge of moving into Korea, and he wanted to prevent them from seizing all of the country, as the United States would be unable to stop them. This suggests that the U.S. and the Soviets were not fully aligned in their goals and were wary of each other's intentions in the region.\n\nThe passage does not depict the relationship as one of comrades-in-arms, as there is no indication of a close, collaborative alliance between the two powers. Nor does it suggest that they were mortal enemies, as they were still willing to engage in negotiations and try to reach a compromise.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the relationship between the United States and the Soviets, as depicted in the passage, is that of uneasy allies, where they were cooperating to some extent but also competing for influence and trying to limit each other's influence in Korea."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year….\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

Specifically, it highlights:\n\n- The harsh punishments, torture, and high death rates of Indians working in the mines of Huancavelica and Potosi.\n- The mine owners and overseers, whether Spanish, mestizo, or Indian, being \"such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice\" as they are not audited or inspected.\n- The Indians not being paid for their labor at the mines, and being forced to perform additional tasks like herding cattle and transporting goods, leading to many deaths.\n- The mine owners using tactics like providing food and drink to the Indians and deducting the costs from their labor, keeping them perpetually in debt.\n- The complicity of colonial officials who collude with the mine owners, rendering the \"protector of the Indians\" useless.\n\nBased on this, the views expressed in the passage seem to be evidence for the imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth (option D). The passage clearly depicts a system where the Spanish and mestizo elite exploit the indigenous Indian population through coercive and abusive practices, with the colonial authorities turning a blind eye. This reflects an entrenched social hierarchy and lack of equality based on one's ancestry and ethnicity.\n\nThe other options are not as well supported by the evidence:\nA) There is no mention of any formal system of debt slavery.\nB) The passage explicitly states the absence of accountability and corruption among the elite.\nC) The king's lack of interest is implied, but not the central focus.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D) The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth."}

The soldier laments that the district officers are demanding land taxes, but the people have nothing left to give (\"you can't get blood from a stone\"). He also says it is better to have a daughter than a son, as the son will likely end up conscripted and sent to distant frontiers.\n\nThis directly contradicts answer choice B, which suggests the Tang had a large, standing professional army with no need for conscription. The poem clearly shows the burden of conscription on the common people.\n\nSimilarly, the poem does not provide direct evidence for the Tang's strong bureaucracy at the local level (A) or advanced agricultural technologies (C). The focus is on the high taxes and conscription demands, not the administrative structure or farming methods.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The poem provides direct evidence for the relatively high level of urbanization in Tang China, as the soldier laments that sons will end up \"lying on some distant prairie\" rather than living near their families in the villages."}

The poem does not suggest a simplistic preference for the West, but a more nuanced appreciation of the transatlantic artistic connections.\n\nD. Lack of a rich indigenous artistic tradition in Africa:\nThis explanation is incorrect. Africa had a long and vibrant artistic tradition that predated European colonization. The poem does not indicate a lack of indigenous African artistic traditions, but rather a willingness on Senghor's part to engage with and be inspired by the cultural landscape of the Americas.\n\nIn conclusion, the best explanation for an African poet writing so lyrically about New York is option B, \"Stronger transatlantic influences linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas.\" The poem reflects a deep appreciation and engagement with the cultural and artistic vibrancy of New York, suggesting significant artistic exchange and cross-pollination between Africa and the Americas at the time."}

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

The second passage notes that the British \"monopoly of violence\" was only temporarily shattered, implying that the British were able to regain control.\n\nWhile the long-term outcome may have been increased British control and the transition to direct rule by the British government rather than the East India Company, the information provided focuses on the immediate aftermath of the events described. Therefore, option D best captures the short-term outcome based on the given passages."}

Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand.\nThis is the most likely answer. Keynes believed that the government should actively intervene in the economy to maintain full employment and high aggregate demand. He argued that left to its own devices, the market would not necessarily reach full employment equilibrium. \n\nIn Bismarck's description, the key issues were worker insecurity and inadequate social support for the poor and unemployed. Keynes would likely have advocated for government policies to address these concerns, such as unemployment benefits, social insurance, and other forms of social safety net. By supporting aggregate demand and ensuring a basic standard of living for workers, the government could help mitigate the insecurity and poverty described by Bismarck.\n\nB, C, and D can be ruled out as they do not align well with Keynes' overall economic philosophy and policy recommendations. Keynes was a strong proponent of active government intervention, not a believer in leaving economic matters entirely to the market.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A.

Counterrevolutionary opponents - This seems the most likely threat the speaker is referring to. The French Revolution faced significant opposition from monarchists, nobility, and others who sought to undermine or overthrow the new revolutionary government.\nB. Foreign invaders - This is also a plausible threat, as the French Revolution had to contend with foreign powers that sought to intervene and suppress the revolutionary movement.\nC. Communist agitators - Communism as an ideology had not yet fully developed during the time of the French Revolution, so this is unlikely to be the primary threat the speaker is addressing.\nD. Transnational corporations - Transnational corporations were not a significant factor in the political landscape of 18th century France, so this is the least likely threat being referred to in the passage.\n\nBased on the context and content of the passage, the threat the speaker seems most concerned with is A.

The diffusion of cultural practices throughout South Africa:\nThe letter does not mention anything about cultural practices or their diffusion in South Africa. It is focused on the writer's personal property and the damages caused by a contingent of native forces. Therefore, this letter is unlikely to be a useful source for information about the diffusion of cultural practices in the region.\n\nB. Economic boons present in British colonies:\nThe letter mentions the writer's insured homestead and a farm of 50 acres, which suggests the presence of some economic activity and assets. However, the letter also discusses the damage and destruction caused by the native forces, indicating that the economic conditions were not entirely favorable. Therefore, the letter may provide some limited information about the economic realities in the British colony, but it is not a particularly useful source for understanding the broader economic boons present in the colonies.\n\nC. Daily challenges of Afrikaners during the colonial period:\nThe letter is written by a British citizen and does not mention anything about the daily challenges faced by the Afrikaners (the Dutch-speaking population in South Africa) during the colonial period. The focus is on the writer's personal property and the damages caused by native forces, which is not directly related to the Afrikaner experience.\n\nD. Unforeseen consequences of British imperialism:\nThis appears to be the most relevant option based on the information provided in the letter. The letter describes the writer's property being damaged and the government being sued for damages caused by a contingent of native forces.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

The development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China.\nThis development does not seem to undermine Mao's hopes. Bringing economic growth to China, even if concentrated in certain regions, could potentially help improve the well-being of the rural population over time.\n\nB. Political friction with the Soviet Union pushed China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War.\nThis development also does not seem to directly undermine Mao's hopes. Shifting political alignments may have impacted China's trajectory, but do not necessarily negate the goals of improving the lot of the rural population.\n\nC. The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry.\nThis development would most directly undermine the hopes expressed by Mao. Mao advocated for the socialist transformation of agriculture and the elimination of the \"rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside\" in order to ensure that \"all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.\" If the actual policies led to famine and increased poverty for the peasantry, this would be the antithesis of Mao's stated goals.\n\nD. Opposition voices in the Communist Party led by men such as Deng Xiaopeng were rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution.\nThis development, while significant, does not seem to directly undermine Mao's hopes as expressed in the passage. The suppression of opposition voices may have impacted the trajectory of China's policies, but does not necessarily negate the goals of improving the well-being of the rural population.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, option C - the cooperatives and emphasis on countryside steel production leading to famine and poverty - would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage."}

The soldier's comments indicate that the Tang government is relying heavily on military force and conscription to maintain its territorial ambitions and control over the frontier.\n\nHowever, the poem also hints at the strains this places on the local populace, with villages being abandoned and fields left untended. This suggests that the Tang's approach was not solely based on military might, but also involved settlement and integration of the frontier regions.\n\nGiven this, the most accurate answer appears to be:\n\nC. The permanent settlement of Han Chinese in frontier zones.\n\nThe poem indicates that the Tang relied on a combination of military force and the integration of Han Chinese communities in the frontier regions to exert control. This aligns with historical evidence that the Tang pursued a policy of \"border colonization\" to expand and secure its western frontier.\n\nWhile diplomatic relationships with nomadic groups were likely also important (option A), the poem focuses more on the hardships faced by the conscripted soldiers rather than diplomatic efforts. And while the Tang military was certainly a key factor (option B), the poem suggests the limitations of a purely military approach.\n\nSo in summary, the evidence points most strongly to the permanent settlement of Han Chinese as a key component of Tang frontier relations, rather than purely military or diplomatic approaches."}

This would have made it increasingly difficult for the native Siberians to fulfill their tribute obligations, as they had fewer animals to hunt and trade.\n\nAdditionally, the loss of horses, which were pawned to the yasak collectors, further hindered the natives' ability to hunt and transport the required furs. This compounds the issue of overhunting and animal depletion.\n\nTherefore, the most significant factor contributing to the burden faced by the native Siberians appears to be the depletion of the furbearing animal populations due to overhunting, as described in the passage."}

The civil rights movements that changed the legal status of minorities in the United States.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe fourth paragraph of the message from Mahatma Gandhi emphasizes the importance of remaining nonviolent, stating that \"Perfect peace and calmness should be observed\" and that this approach can lead to the \"redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs\" if the people can \"remain non-violent.\"\n\nThis message of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience most directly inspired the civil rights movements in the United States, which used peaceful protest and civil disobedience to challenge racial segregation and discrimination and change the legal status of minorities.\n\nThe civil rights movement, led by figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and others, directly drew inspiration from Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent resistance. They employed tactics like sit-ins, marches, and boycotts to bring about desegregation and voting rights for African Americans.\n\nIn contrast, the other options do not have a direct connection to Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance. The Zionist movement, the independence movements in Southeast Asia, and the communist movement in Cuba did not necessarily embrace the same nonviolent approach that Gandhi advocated.\n\nTherefore, the civil rights movements in the United States are the historical developments that were most likely inspired by Gandhi's instructions to remain nonviolent."}

Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.\nThis does not seem to be the most accurate explanation based on the passage. The passage focuses on the exploitation and draining of African wealth by the imperialist system, rather than the importation of New World foodstuffs.\n\nB. Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.\nThis option aligns better with the passage, which mentions the Europeans extending their exploitation to cover the whole of Africa. Obtaining firearms through trade with Europeans could have helped African states and kingdoms consolidate their power.\n\nC. Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.\nThis option is very relevant to the passage, which focuses on the exploitation of Africa.

The rural peasantry:\nThe chart shows a significant increase in literacy rates, from 24% in 1897 to 99.9% in 1955. This suggests that the rural peasantry, who likely had very low literacy rates initially, would have seen a substantial improvement in their access to education and ability to read and write. The transition from a largely illiterate peasantry to near-universal literacy would have had a transformative impact on this segment of the population.\n\nB. Members of the Russian Orthodox clergy:\nThe Russian Orthodox clergy were generally more educated and literate than the general population, even in the late 19th century. While the rising literacy rates would have improved the overall educational level of the clergy, they were likely already more literate than the rural peasantry and urban middle class. Therefore, the clergy may have benefited, but to a lesser degree than the rural peasantry.\n\nC. The urban middle class:\nThe urban middle class would have also benefited from the rising literacy rates, as they were more likely to have access to education and literacy resources than the rural peasantry. However, the chart suggests that the literacy rate among the general population was relatively low in the late 19th century, indicating that the urban middle class may have already had higher literacy levels compared to the rest of the population. Therefore, the urban middle class may have benefited, but not to the same extent as the rural peasantry.\n\nD. Officers in the armed forces:\nThe officers in the armed forces were likely already more educated and literate than the general population, even in the late 19th century. While the rising literacy rates would have improved the overall educational level of the armed forces, they were likely already more literate than the rural peasantry and urban middle class. Therefore, the officers in the armed forces may have benefited, but to a lesser degree than the rural peasantry.\n\nBased on the information provided, my assessment is that the rural peasantry would have benefited the most from the rising literacy rates depicted in the chart. The transition from a largely illiterate peasantry to near-universal literacy would have had a transformative impact on this segment of the population, providing them with greater access to education, knowledge, and opportunities."}

The government dismantled the Chinese-style civil service system - This is not an accurate characterization of Japan's response during this era, as the civil service system remained largely intact.\n\nB. The government undertook a program of conquest in the Pacific - There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that Japan responded by initiating a program of military conquest during this time period.\n\nD.

Development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe:\nThis option seems most plausible based on the content of Bismarck's speech. He highlights the worker's \"insecurity of his existence\" and lack of social support, even when they have worked diligently. Bismarck's recognition of this issue likely contributed to the development of social welfare programs in Germany and influenced the adoption of similar programs across Europe over the long term. This aligns with the historical trend of the rise of social security and other socialized programs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nB. Disunity of the German states:\nThe speech does not mention anything about the disunity of the German states. Bismarck was the Chancellor of the newly unified German Empire at the time, so it is unlikely that his speech would have led to increased disunity. This option is not supported by the information provided.\n\nC. Communist overhaul of the eastern parts of Germany:\nThe speech does not discuss communism or any political upheaval in Germany. There is no evidence that Bismarck's speech directly led to a communist overhaul of the eastern parts of Germany. This option is not a reasonable long-term effect of this speech.\n\nD. A decrease in German economic output:\nThe speech does not indicate that Bismarck's recognition of the worker's insecurity would have led to a decrease in German economic output.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre", "choices": ["was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.", "can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.", "should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.", "seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy."], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "After carefully analyzing the information provided in the two passages, I believe the most accurate answer is:\n\nB. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n\nThe second passage provides valuable context and analysis that supports this interpretation. It states that \"violence was an essential component of the British presence in India\" and that the British had \"constructed a monopoly of violence\" in ruling the country. The passage then suggests that the Cawnpore Massacre can be seen as an \"indigenous violence of the colonized\" that \"shattered\" the British monopoly on violence. \n\nThis indicates that the massacre was not an isolated, premeditated act, but rather a violent reaction by the colonized population against the systemic brutality and oppression of British rule. The passage frames it as an understandable, if horrific, response to the dehumanizing treatment and denial of \"humanness\" that the British imposed on the Indian people.\n\nWhile the first passage provides a more condemnatory view of the Cawnpore Massacre, the second passage offers crucial historical and contextual analysis that gives a more nuanced perspective on the event. It suggests the massacre was not simply an unjustified atrocity, but a complex, multifaceted reaction to the violent realities of colonial domination.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, option B best captures the interpretation presented in the second passage."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties.

Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals.

At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River.

Military campaigns:\nThe passage does not mention any military campaigns or conflicts. It focuses on the economic and commercial aspects of the port city of Aden, such as the wealth of the merchants, the trade between Aden and various Indian ports, and the treatment of strangers. There is no indication that military campaigns directly led to the development of the described economic system.\n\nB. Meteorological phenomena:\nThe passage does mention that Aden is surrounded by mountains and has no crops, trees, or water, but it has reservoirs to collect rainwater. This suggests that the local climate and meteorological conditions played a role in the development of the economic system, as the lack of natural resources likely necessitated a reliance on trade and commerce.\n\nC. Competition with European trade networks:\nThe passage does not mention any competition with European trade networks.

There is no indication that competition with European trade networks directly led to the development of the economic system described.\n\nD. The presence of highly developed port cities:\nThe passage strongly suggests that the presence of a highly developed port city, Aden, was a key factor in the development of the economic system described. The city is described as a major port for Indian and Egyptian merchants, with a thriving trade and wealthy merchants. The strategic location of the city, surrounded by mountains and accessible from only one side, also contributed to its economic importance.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the most relevant factor that directly led to the development of the economic system described is the presence of a highly developed port city, Aden. The passage emphasizes the city's role as a hub for trade and commerce, with a significant merchant class and a reliance on trade and commerce due to the lack of natural resources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The presence of highly developed port cities."}

Accordingly undertake this journey for the remission of your sins, with the assurance of the imperishable glory of the kingdom of heaven.\"\nPope Urban II, Speech at the Council of Clermont as recorded by Robert the Monk, 1095 C.E.\nWhich of the following events most directly inspired Urban's invocation of Constantinople in the first paragraph?", "choices": ["The conquest of Constantinople by the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate", "The invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks", "The invasion of the Balkans by the Avars and Bulgars", "The conversion of the people of Constantinople to Catholic Christianity"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To determine the event that most directly inspired Urban's invocation of Constantinople in the first paragraph, I will analyze the context and details provided in the passage.\n\nThe key details are:\n- \"From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth...\"\n- \"The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months.\"\n\nThis suggests that the event being referenced is some kind of invasion or conquest of territory belonging to the Byzantine (Greek) Empire, centered around Constantinople.\n\nOf the options provided:\n\nA. The conquest of Constantinople by the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate - This is not the correct event, as the Abbasids never conquered Constantinople. The city remained under Byzantine control during this time period.\n\nB. The invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks - This is the most likely answer. The Seljuk Turks had invaded and conquered large swaths of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) from the Byzantines in the decades leading up to the Council of Clermont in 1095. This directly matches the description of the \"kingdom of the Greeks\" being \"dismembered\" and losing territory.\n\nC. The invasion of the Balkans by the Avars and Bulgars - This occurred centuries earlier, in the 6th-7th centuries, and does not match the timeframe or details provided in the passage.\n\nD. The conversion of the people of Constantinople to Catholic Christianity - This did not involve any territorial losses or invasion, so it does not fit the context.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the event that most directly inspired Urban's invocation of Constantinople was the invasion and conquest of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBy what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nOn which of the following arguments does the author of the passage principally base his appeal?", "choices": ["It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.", "Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral.", "Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade.", "Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To determine the principal argument that the author of the passage is basing his appeal on, I will carefully analyze the key points made in the passage.\n\nThe passage primarily focuses on the issue of Britain exporting opium to China, which the Chinese trade commissioner Lin Zexu strongly opposes. The key arguments made in the passage are:\n\nA. It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.\nThis is the main argument made in the passage. Lin Zexu directly points out the hypocrisy of Britain prohibiting opium in its own country, yet still exporting it to China, which he sees as harmful.\n\nB. Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral.\nThe passage does not mention anything about Confucian teachings or the inherent immorality of narcotics. This is not the principal argument.\n\nC. Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade.\nThe passage does not discuss the impact of opium addiction on China's trade balance. This is not a central argument made.\n\nD. Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state.\nThe passage does not make any explicit arguments about the military power of China compared to Britain. This is not the principal focus.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the principal argument that the author of the passage bases his appeal on is A - the hypocrisy of Britain selling a substance banned in its own country to China."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nI have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n—Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nIn his letter, Martin Luther avoided speaking about which of the following topics?", "choices": ["The wealth of the church", "The power of the clergy", "The sale of indulgences", "The political nature of the church"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "Based on the information provided in the passage, the topic that Martin Luther avoided speaking about in his letter appears to be:\n\nC. The sale of indulgences\n\nThe passage does not mention anything about the sale of indulgences, which was one of the key issues that sparked the Protestant Reformation. Instead, Luther focuses on criticizing the wealth and worldly pomp of the Pope and the cardinals, as well as the three walls the Romanists had built around themselves to protect themselves from reform.\n\nThe passage indicates that Luther was addressing \"the distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany\" and the need for reform, but does not specifically discuss the issue of indulgences. This suggests that Luther did not address that topic in this particular letter."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAlthough in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward.\n—Robert K. Massie, Peter the Great: His Life and World\nBased on the above passage, what kinds of reforms did Peter the Great embrace?", "choices": ["Creation of an elected assembly", "Declarations of human rights", "Development of a constitutional monarchy", "Reduction of aristocratic influence"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": -1, "completion": "To determine the kind of reforms that Peter the Great embraced based on the given passage, I will carefully analyze the information provided.\n\nThe passage states that in Protestant Europe, Peter the Great was \"surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments.\" This suggests that the reforms he was exposed to in Europe included:\n\nA. Creation of an elected assembly\nB. Declarations of human rights\nC. Development of a constitutional monarchy\n\nHowever, the passage goes on to say that Peter the Great \"did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people.\" Instead, he was \"convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force.\" The passage further states that he would \"try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward.\"\n\nBased on this, it seems that Peter the Great did not embrace reforms that would reduce aristocratic influence or shift power away from himself. Instead, he was determined to drive reforms and transform Russia himself, rather than sharing power with the people.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Reduction of aristocratic influence\n\nThe passage does not indicate that Peter the Great embraced reforms that would create an elected assembly, declare human rights, or develop a constitutional monarchy. Rather, it suggests he sought to maintain and consolidate his own power to drive the transformation of Russia."}
