Portuguese traders bring white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain to Japan.\n2. They bring back primarily silver from Japan.\n3. They also bring silver from India.\n4. They use this silver to trade in China.\n5. From China, they obtain gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and other goods.\n\nThe main pattern here is that European traders (Portuguese) are using silver as a key commodity to purchase goods from China. China appears to be primarily interested in silver.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA. The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants - This option directly addresses the trade imbalance described. If Europeans found goods that China wanted, it would change the silver-centric trade pattern.\n\nB. Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas - While important, these don't directly relate to the described trade patterns.\n\nC. The Industrial Revolution - While this had significant economic impacts, it doesn't directly address the specific China-silver trade dynamic described.\n\nD. The colonization of Africa - This also doesn't directly relate to the China-silver trade pattern.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer is most likely A. The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants. This development would most directly change the trade pattern where Europeans primarily used silver to purchase Chinese goods."}

Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a set of expectations for women that are primarily focused on domestic duties, household management, and family-oriented responsibilities. This indicates a shift towards confining women's roles to the private sphere of the home.\n\n2. The text emphasizes tasks such as \"perform domestic duties,\" \"finish completely, tidily, and systematically,\" and \"cleanse and purify and arrange in order the wine and the food for the offerings to the ancestors.\" These are all activities that take place within the household.\n\n3. The passage also stresses qualities like \"purity and quietness of spirit\" and discourages \"gossip and silly laughter,\" suggesting that women should maintain a low profile and focus on their domestic responsibilities.\n\n4. Historically, the period from 600 BCE to 600 CE saw the rise and development of many patriarchal societies, particularly in agricultural and urban settings. This often led to more restricted roles for women compared to earlier, more nomadic or hunter-gatherer societies.\n\n5. The other options are not supported by the text or historical evidence:\n   A. The text does not mention women as primary earners.\n   B. While childcare is implied, it's not specifically highlighted as a new responsibility.\n   D.

The speech was given in 1955 at the Bandung Conference, which was a meeting of Asian and African states, many of which were newly independent.\n\n2. Sukarno emphasizes the importance of peace and independence for these nations.\n\n3. He calls for the nations of Asia and Africa to unite their voices for peace and reason in world affairs.\n\n4. The speech hints at a desire to avoid being drawn into larger conflicts between other powers.\n\nGiven this information, we can consider each option:\n\nA. The Arab-Israeli conflict: While important, this was not a global conflict that threatened to draw in all nations.\n\nB. The Korean War: This ended in 1953, two years before this speech.\n\nC. The Cold War: This was the major global conflict of the time, pitting the United States against the Soviet Union and threatening to draw in other nations.\n\nD. The Vietnam conflicts: While significant, these were not yet at their peak in 1955 and were more regional than global.\n\nThe most likely answer is C. The Cold War. Sukarno's speech reflects the desire of many newly independent nations to avoid being forced to choose sides between the US and USSR during the Cold War. This policy became known as the Non-Aligned Movement, which sought to maintain neutrality in the Cold War.\n\nIndonesia, under Sukarno's leadership, did indeed attempt to maintain a neutral stance during the Cold War, though this became increasingly difficult as tensions rose globally.

Meritocratic appointments by rulers to their bureaucracies:\nThe passage does suggest this. The narrator (Sanehat) says, \"Thus my excellence was in his heart; he loved me and he knew my valor; ...he set me at the head of his sons, when he saw the success of my handiwork.\" This indicates that the ruler appointed Sanehat based on his abilities and achievements.\n\nB. Long-distance contact between Egypt and other lands:\nThe passage clearly shows this. Sanehat is an Egyptian serving as a commander in the Syrian army, and he describes conquering various lands. This demonstrates significant interaction between Egypt and other regions.\n\nC. The clan as the basic political unit:\nThere's little evidence for this in the passage. While it mentions a \"tribe\" once, it's in reference to the challenger, not to the main political structure described.\n\nD. A lack of emphasis on martial ability:\nThis is contradicted by the passage. The text heavily emphasizes military prowess, with descriptions of conquests and a challenge based on fighting ability.\n\nAfter considering all options, the strongest evidence is for:\n\nB. Long-distance contact between Egypt and other lands\n\nThis is clearly demonstrated throughout the passage, with an Egyptian serving in Syria and describing conquests of various lands.

Use of the term \"idolatrous\": This explicitly religious term suggests that the slavers viewed their targets as having false religious beliefs, implying a religious motivation for their actions.\n\n2. \"Koholanes\": While described as a pejorative term for \"black Africans,\" the use of a specific term to describe the target group could indicate a religious or cultural distinction beyond just race.\n\n3.

The Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919 at the end of World War I. It imposed harsh penalties on Germany, including territorial losses, military restrictions, and enormous reparations payments.\n\n2. In his speech, Hitler refers to the treaty as the Versailles \"Diktat\" (dictate), suggesting it was forced upon Germany unfairly. He states that \"A signature was forced out of us with pistols at our head and with the threat of hunger for millions of people.\"\n\n3.

Europe - Although Europe was involved in the silver trade, it wasn't the primary source of silver for China.\n\nC. The Middle East - This region was more of a trade intermediary rather than a major silver producer for China.\n\nD. The New World - This is the correct answer. In the late 16th century, the Spanish Empire was extracting enormous amounts of silver from mines in their American colonies, particularly from Potosí in present-day Bolivia. This silver was then traded across the Pacific to China via the Manila Galleon trade route or across the Atlantic and then to Asia via European traders.\n\nThe influx of New World silver into China was so significant that it had major economic impacts, including inflation and changes in the Chinese monetary system.

International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\n\nThe passage provides clear evidence of international trade, with specific details about the exchange of copper for gold between different regions. This trade connection demonstrates that international trade networks were active and possibly still evolving during the period 600-1450 C.E."}

The speaker mentions \"1.4 billion strong,\" referring to the combined population of Asia and Africa.\n\nNow, let's examine each option:\n\nA. The formation of the non-aligned movement\nThis option aligns closely with the content and context of the speech. The Bandung Conference of 1955 was a significant precursor to the Non-Aligned Movement, which officially formed in 1961. The speech's emphasis on peace, independence, and the collective voice of Asian and African nations strongly reflects the principles of non-alignment.\n\nB. Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation\nWhile peace is mentioned, the passage doesn't specifically address disarmament or nuclear issues.\n\nC. The Green Revolution in agriculture\nThis option is not related to the content of the speech, which focuses on political and diplomatic matters rather than agricultural advancements.\n\nD. Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology\nWhile the speech does call for Asian (and African) unity, it's not exclusively pan-Asian. Moreover, it's more focused on diplomatic cooperation than a broader ideological movement.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate answer is A. The formation of the non-aligned movement. This speech, given at the Bandung Conference, embodies the principles and goals that would later form the basis of the Non-Aligned Movement, emphasizing independence, peace, and cooperation among newly independent nations of Asia and Africa."}

The first quote is from the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam. It clearly prohibits \"strong drink\" (alcohol) among other things, calling it \"Satan's handiwork.\"\n\n2. The second quote is from the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, a collection of poems by the Persian mathematician, astronomer, and poet Omar Khayyám. This verse encourages drinking wine when roses bloom, presenting a more hedonistic view.\n\n3. Omar Khayyám was a Muslim who lived in the 11th-12th centuries, during what's considered the Islamic Golden Age.\n\n4. The contrast between these two quotes shows that while the Qur'an prohibits alcohol, there were Muslim poets and thinkers who celebrated it.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. This doesn't directly relate to atheism, so it's not supported.\n\nB. This is the most supportable conclusion. The existence of Muslim poetry celebrating wine suggests that not all Muslims strictly followed the Qur'anic prohibition on alcohol.\n\nC. There's no information about Christian missionaries or conversions here.\n\nD. While Omar Khayyám's verse could be seen as contrary to traditional practice, we can't generalize this to \"Muslim intellectuals\" as a whole. This is too broad a conclusion from just one example.\n\nTherefore, the best-supported conclusion is B: Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims. This comparison shows that despite clear religious prohibitions, some Muslims, at least in poetry, celebrated practices that went against these restrictions."}

The rise of anti-Semitic ideologies: Neither passage specifically mentions or targets Jewish people.\n\nB. Trade protectionism: While these acts may have economic implications, they're primarily focused on immigration, not trade.\n\nC. A growing desire to attract skilled labor from abroad: The Australian act does mention an exception for workers with special skills, but this is not the primary focus of either law.\n\nD. Hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment: Both acts clearly demonstrate a desire to restrict immigration, particularly targeting specific groups (non-Europeans in Australia, Chinese in the U.S.).\n\nReasoning: Both passages show explicit attempts to limit immigration, with the U.S. law being particularly targeted against Chinese laborers. The Australian law, while more general, still aims to restrict immigration through language tests and other measures. These laws reflect a growing negative sentiment towards immigrants in both countries during this period.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that best describes the prominent social trend exemplified by these passages is:\n\nD.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": ["Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown", "Killing of civilians during wartime", "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction", "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "Based on the information provided in the two passages, the form of violence that best connects with them is:\n\nB. Killing of civilians during wartime\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Both passages discuss violence in the context of the Indian Mutiny (or Revolt) of 1857, which was essentially a wartime situation between Indian rebels and British colonial forces.\n\n2. The first passage by William Howard Russell explicitly mentions the killing of \"poor helpless ladies and children\" by the rebelling Indians, which clearly indicates the targeting of civilians.\n\n3. Russell describes it as a \"war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge,\" emphasizing the conflict's nature as more than just a military engagement.\n\n4. The second passage by Rudrangshu Mukherjee discusses how the revolt \"shattered\" the British monopoly on violence in India, implying that violence was now being perpetrated by both sides.\n\n5. While Mukherjee's passage doesn't explicitly mention civilian deaths, it does talk about the \"bodies of the British\" and how the Indians were treated as less than human, suggesting a breakdown of the usual protections civilians might expect.\n\nThe other options don't fit as well:\n\nA. Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown - While economic factors may have played a role in the revolt, the passages focus more on racial, religious, and power dynamics rather than socio-economic issues.\n\nC. Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction - There's no mention of such weapons in either passage.\n\nD. State-sponsored campaigns of genocide - While there are elements of racial violence, neither passage describes a systematic, state-sponsored attempt to eradicate an entire group of people.\n\nTherefore, the form of violence that best connects these passages is the killing of civilians during wartime."}

Mutual Assured Destruction: This was a doctrine of military strategy in which full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would result in the destruction of both. This is more about preventing nuclear war rather than limiting territorial control.\n\nC. Dollar Diplomacy: This was a foreign policy initiative of the early 20th century, predating the Cold War.

It demonstrates how Western European capitalists exploited African resources (in this case, human resources) for their economic gain in other parts of their colonial empire. This practice drained Africa of its population and labor force, which would have significantly impacted the continent's development.\n\nB.

We see that:\n- Multiple kings (Shapur, Hormizd, Bahram) conferred honors and authority on Kerdir, a religious figure.\n- The kings supported the establishment of fires (religious sites) and the prosperity of magi (priests).\n- There's emphasis on the \"divine services\" and the Mazdayanian religion gaining prominence under royal support.\n\nB. Rulers were limited in their political authority by powerful religious figures.\nWhile religious figures like Kerdir were given authority, there's no evidence that they limited the rulers' power. Instead, it appears that rulers were granting authority to religious figures.\n\nC. Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through victories over foreign peoples.\nThe text doesn't mention military victories or conquests as a source of legitimacy.\n\nD. Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through the consent of those they governed.\nThere's no mention of the general population's consent or approval in the text.\n\nBased on this analysis, the option that is best supported by the source is:\n\nA. Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests.\n\nThe text repeatedly emphasizes how rulers supported and elevated religious figures and practices, suggesting that this was an important aspect of their rule and likely a source of legitimacy."}

This option is not supported by the passage. The text does not compare Muslim and Christian attitudes towards peace.\n\nB. This option contradicts the passage. The text states that \"most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam,\" which implies an expansionist rather than a purely defensive stance.\n\nC. While the passage does discuss jihad, it doesn't characterize Muslims as \"inherently violent.\" The focus is more on religious and political obligations rather than innate characteristics.\n\nD. This option aligns most closely with the content of the passage. The text mentions that \"most authorities\" supported the idea of ongoing jihad, and that the Bahr al-Fava'id (a text likely written by Muslim elites) insisted that pursuing jihad was the \"first duty of a Muslim ruler.\"\n\nAfter considering all options, D appears to be the best answer.

No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . .

The passage is discussing the end of World War II and the surrender of Japanese forces in Korea, implying that Korea was being liberated from Japanese control, not becoming part of Japan.\n\nB.

Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.\nThis option aligns most closely with the information provided and the historical outcome. Bonesteel's decision to use the 38th parallel as a dividing line for the surrender of Japanese forces effectively created two zones of control in Korea.\n\nGiven the historical context and the long-term consequences of this decision, option D is the most accurate answer. The division at the 38th parallel, initially intended as a temporary measure for accepting the Japanese surrender, became the de facto border between North and South Korea. This division persists to this day, with two separate Korean nations existing on either side of the 38th parallel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

Let's examine the relevant part of the passage:\n\n\"Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for oppression he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.\"\n\nThis phrase tells us about the ruler's status and the nature of his rule. Let's consider each option:\n\nA. He had the Mandate of Heaven.\nThis option seems to be the most fitting. The passage mentions that the king \"brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess\" and substituted oppression with \"generous gentleness.\" In Chinese philosophy, the Mandate of Heaven was the right to rule granted by Heaven to just and virtuous rulers. The description of the king's virtues and the emphasis on continuing this virtuous rule strongly suggest that he had the Mandate of Heaven.\n\nB. He was an absolute monarch.\nWhile the king clearly had power, there's no specific indication that he was an absolute monarch. The text emphasizes virtue and responsibility more than absolute power.\n\nC. He had lost the blessing of the gods.\nThis is incorrect. The passage portrays the king positively and suggests that he had divine favor, not that he had lost it.\n\nD. He was killed as a result of natural disasters.\nThere's no mention of the king being killed or of any natural disasters affecting him directly.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer is most likely A. He had the Mandate of Heaven. The text's emphasis on the king's virtue, his favorable comparison to previous rulers, and the importance placed on continuing this virtuous rule all align with the concept of the Mandate of Heaven in Chinese political philosophy."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n—Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich of the following was a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s?", "choices": ["Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance).", "Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.", "Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.", "Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To answer this question, we need to consider the long-term effects of Mongol rule on Russia and compare them with the options provided. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance).\nThis is the most plausible answer. The Mongol conquest of Russia in the 13th century, known as the \"Mongol yoke,\" lasted for about 240 years. During this period, Russia was largely isolated from Western Europe, missing out on significant developments like the Renaissance. This isolation contributed to Russia's distinct cultural and political development compared to Western European nations.\n\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.\nThis is incorrect. The administrative center of the Mongol Empire was not in Russia but in Mongolia and later in China. Russia was a conquered territory, not the center of Mongol administration.\n\nC. Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.\nThis is also incorrect. While the Mongols were tolerant of various religions, as mentioned in the passage, Orthodox Christianity remained the dominant religion in Russia. Islam did not become the majority religion in Russia as a result of Mongol rule.\n\nD. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\nWhile the Mongols did influence Russian administrative practices, the development of a centralized bureaucracy in Russia was a much later process, primarily occurring under the tsars after the Mongol period. This option oversimplifies a complex historical process.\n\nAfter considering all options, A seems to be the most accurate long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia. The isolation from Western Europe during Mongol rule had a lasting impact on Russia's development, setting it apart from Western European nations in many ways."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBut the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?", "choices": ["Tang and Ottoman", "Ming and Aztec", "Han and Gupta", "Qin and Etruscan"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the reasons given for Rome's fall and then consider which other empires might have experienced similar issues. The key factors mentioned are:\n\n1. Immoderate greatness and overextension\n2. Prosperity leading to decay\n3. Military becoming corrupt and less effective\n4. Weakening of discipline\n5. Invasion by \"Barbarians\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Tang and Ottoman:\nBoth empires did experience decline due to overextension and military issues. The Ottoman Empire, in particular, faced many of the problems described for Rome.\n\nB. Ming and Aztec:\nThe Ming dynasty did face some similar issues, but the Aztec Empire's fall was more abrupt and primarily due to Spanish conquest.\n\nC. Han and Gupta:\nBoth of these empires experienced decline that aligns well with the reasons given for Rome. They grew too large, faced internal corruption, and eventually succumbed to invasions.\n\nD. Qin and Etruscan:\nThe Qin dynasty was short-lived and fell due to different reasons. The Etruscan civilization was actually absorbed by Rome rather than falling in a manner similar to Rome's decline.\n\nAfter considering these options, the best answer appears to be C. Han and Gupta. These empires most closely match the pattern of decline described for Rome, including overextension, internal decay, and eventual fall to outside invaders.\n\nThe Han dynasty, like Rome, expanded greatly, faced internal corruption and military issues, and eventually fell to nomadic invasions. The Gupta Empire also expanded significantly, experienced a golden age of prosperity, and then declined due to internal issues and external invasions.\n\nWhile the Ottoman Empire (in option A) also fits some of these criteria, the Tang dynasty's fall was less similar to Rome's. Therefore, C. Han and Gupta remains the best answer among the given options."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Al-Zawawi also said 'This sultan Musa told me that at a town called ZKRY he has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. \"There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in. Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explicitly mentions two important mineral resources: copper and gold. \n\n2. Mansa Musa states that copper is the only good on which a duty is levied in his kingdom, indicating its economic importance.\n\n3. The text describes a lucrative trade where copper is exchanged for gold with the \"pagan Sudan\" at a very favorable rate (100 measures of copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold).\n\n4. The passage also mentions that there are \"pagan nations\" in Mali who are employed in extracting gold from deposits, describing the process of gold mining.\n\n5. The fact that these are the only economic activities mentioned in the passage, and that Musa emphasizes the uniqueness of the copper duty, suggests that mineral exploitation was a primary source of Mali's wealth.\n\nWhile options B, C, and D might have played roles in Mali's economy, they are not supported by the information given in this specific passage. The text doesn't mention conquests, agricultural estates, or the slave trade. Instead, it focuses on the exploitation and trade of minerals, particularly copper and gold.\n\nTherefore, based on the passage, option A is the most strongly supported answer."}

Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems\nThis is a strong possibility. The development of writing systems and the emergence of urban centers with specialized roles, including scribes, would have been crucial for recording and preserving long, complex narratives like epics.\n\nB. The rise of a merchant class in cities who could sponsor the creation of original art\nWhile merchants might have played a role in sponsoring art, this doesn't seem to be the primary origin of epic poetry specifically.\n\nC. The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings\nAlthough religious elements are present in many epics, including Gilgamesh, this option seems too narrow and specific to explain the origins of epic poetry as a whole.\n\nD. The rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording\nThis is also a strong possibility. Many epics, including Gilgamesh, focus on the deeds of heroes and kings, suggesting that the existence of such figures was important to the development of the genre.\n\nAfter considering these options, I believe the best answer is A: The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the earliest known written stories, dating back to around 2100 BCE. This coincides with the development of writing systems in Mesopotamian cities.\n2. The complexity and length of epics like Gilgamesh would have required a system for recording and preserving them, which scribes could provide.\n3. The urban setting described in the passage (Uruk, its walls, and temples) aligns with the development of cities where specialized roles like scribes would have emerged.\n4. While option D (warrior elite) is also relevant to the content of epics, the ability to record and preserve these stories was crucial to their development as a literary form.\n\nTherefore, while the deeds of kings and heroes were often the subject of epics, it was the existence of a literate class that could record these stories that best explains the origins of epic poetry as a genre."}

That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like.
