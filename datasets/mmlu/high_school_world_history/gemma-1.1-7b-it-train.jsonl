Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nThe passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence?", "choices": ["Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown", "Killing of civilians during wartime", "Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction", "State-sponsored campaigns of genocide"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "**B.

Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals.**\n\nThe passage states that Musa claimed that there was no duty levied on any goods in his kingdom except for a type of copper that was exported for profit. This suggests that the kingdom of Mali derived a significant portion of its wealth from the exploitation of natural resources."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"When the gods fashioned Gilgamesh*, to him they gave a perfect form. The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him.\nOf Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stone—it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk.\"\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E.\n*Gilgamesh was a king of Uruk.\nWhich of the following best describes the origins of epic poetry such as the Epic of Gilgamesh?", "choices": ["The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems", "The rise of a merchant class in cities who could sponsor the creation of original art", "The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings", "The rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "**A. The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems**\n\nThe passage suggests that the Epic of Gilgamesh was composed by literate scribes who were able to record and preserve the epic poem. The emergence of a literate class in cities during the ancient Mesopotamian period played a significant role in the development of epic poetry."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright © 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?", "choices": ["The colonization of the interior of Africa", "The conquest of the Aztec Empire", "The reformation of Catholic Christianity", "The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "**A. The colonization of the interior of Africa**\n\nThe colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers during the 15th to 18th centuries significantly increased the agricultural and mineral resources available to Western Europe, enabling them to expand their industrial and technological capabilities."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.\nFirstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\nSecondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\nThirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…\n…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.\"\nMartin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520\nWhen the author of the passage above discusses the \"second wall,\" to what is he referring?", "choices": ["The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate definition of \"Holy Ghost\"", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate theological belief about the divinity of Jesus", "The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate method of baptism"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "**B. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts**\n\nThe author argues that the Romanists (Catholics) claim exclusive authority over the interpretation of the Scriptures, which the Reformers disagree with."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"My little homestead in the city, which I recently insured for ￡2,000 would no doubt have shared the common fate, as the insurance companies will not make good that which is destroyed by the Queen's enemies. And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around.\"\nLetter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879\nIncidents such as those described by the author of the letter were used by the British government to do which of the following?", "choices": ["Issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu", "Tax the Zulu kingdom to cover damages attributed to them", "Sever its responsibility to protect citizens who chose to live in South Africa", "Liberate the Zulus from British colonialism"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "**B.
