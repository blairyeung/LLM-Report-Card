{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?", "choices": ["They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.", "They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.", "They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.", "They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology."], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the passage and the options provided.\n\nThe passage explains that early gunpowder weapons were heavy and slow to fire, but still useful in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare in Western Europe during the 1200s-1400s. In contrast, China was threatened by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons were not effective. As a result, China focused on improving its horse archer units to combat this threat.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. The passage does not mention Confucian traditionalism as a factor in China's decision not to lead in gunpowder weaponry innovation. This option is not supported by the passage.\n\nB. The passage does not suggest that China put too much faith in the numerical strength of its existing armed forces. In fact, it implies that China was responding to a specific military threat (the steppe nomads) by developing a more effective countermeasure (horse archer units).\n\nC. This option is supported by the passage. China \"logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs,\" which were horse archer units that could effectively combat the mobile steppe nomads.\n\nD. The passage does not mention that China could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology. In fact, it implies that China was making a strategic decision to focus on a different type of military development.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs."}

He even goes so far as to say that it was a \"grander\" spectacle because it happened without Roman intervention, implying that the Romans got to enjoy the show without having to lift a finger. This tone suggests a strong sense of disdain and contempt for the barbarian peoples, rather than concern or fear.\n\nAdditionally, Tacitus's prayer that the tribes will \"ever retain... hatred for each other\" implies that he sees their discord as a boon to the Roman Empire, rather than a threat. This further supports the idea that the excerpt is evidence of a negative view of barbarian peoples, rather than concern about their attacks.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA. Disgust for barbarian peoples: This option aligns with the tone and content of the excerpt, which expresses contempt and pleasure at the misfortune of the Bructeri.\n\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks: While the excerpt does mention the Bructeri, it does not express concern about their attacks. Instead, it seems to revel in their defeat.\n\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy: While Tacitus's tone may not be in line with Stoic ideals of compassion and indifference to external events, this option is not directly supported by the excerpt.\n\nD. Maintenance of large armies: There is no mention of Roman armies or military strength in the excerpt, so this option is not supported.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that the correct answer is:\n\nA.

The Act was enacted in response to the large influx of Chinese immigrants to the United States, particularly to the West Coast, during the mid-to-late 19th century.\n\nDuring this period, the United States was undergoing rapid industrialization and expansion, including the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad. The railroad project required a massive workforce, and many Chinese laborers were recruited to work on the project. The construction of the railroad was a significant economic activity that drove the rising levels of immigration from China.\n\nIn contrast, fertilizer harvesting, sugarcane production, and gold mining were not as significant in driving Chinese immigration to the United States during this period.\n\nTherefore, based on the historical context and the economic activities of the time, I conclude that:\n\nThe final answer is A."}

The first wall is the claim that the \"temporal power\" has no jurisdiction over them, and that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\n\nThe term \"temporal\" is often used in contrast to \"spiritual\" or \"ecclesiastical.\" In this context, Luther is likely using \"temporal\" to refer to the secular or worldly authority, as opposed to the spiritual authority of the Church.\n\nFurthermore, the passage suggests that the Romanists are trying to shield themselves from the authority of the state or secular powers. This implies that the \"temporal power\" refers to the authority of the state, monarchs, or secular leaders, rather than a clerical or ecclesiastical authority.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and language used in the passage, the \"temporal power\" is best understood as a state or secular authority.\n\nFinal verdict: C.

This implies that the Mughal Empire's control over the zamindars was not absolute, and the zamindars had some degree of autonomy.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\nA. Religious toleration: While the Mughal Empire was known for its religious toleration, there is no direct connection between this policy and the zamindars' ability to establish a claim to sovereignty.\n\nB. Universal taxation: The text mentions that the zamindars paid revenue to the Mughal Empire, which suggests that taxation was a key aspect of their relationship. The fact that refusing to pay revenue was a means for zamindars to assert their sovereignty implies that the Mughal Empire's taxation policy was not always effectively enforced.\n\nC.

This suggests that the British Empire has a governing presence in India, with Bentinck as a high-ranking official.\n\nPassage 2 is written by George Simpson, the Head of the Northern Department of the Hudson's Bay Company, a trading company. Simpson is discussing the need to rule the Indians who trade with them \"with a rod of iron\" to keep them in a state of subordination, implying that the company has some level of authority over these Indians.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\nA. Direct rule by the crown: While Bentinck's passage suggests a governing presence, it does not necessarily imply direct rule by the crown. The British East India Company, which is not explicitly mentioned, played a significant role in governing India during this period.\n\nB. Complete privatization of colonial authority: This option is not supported by the passages, as both authors seem to be associated with institutions that have some level of official authority.\n\nC. Martial law enforced by sizable armies: There is no mention of martial law or sizable armies in either passage.\n\nD. The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits: This option is the most plausible, as the Hudson's Bay Company (Passage 2) is a chartered company, and the British East India Company, which is implied by Bentinck's passage, was also a chartered company. These companies were granted charters by the British monarch to trade and govern in specific regions, assuming costs and sharing profits with the crown.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final verdict is:\n\nD. The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n—Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

However, it also mentions that Bonesteel was trying to prevent the Russians from seizing all of Korea, which implies that there was a level of mistrust or competition between the two countries.\n\nAdditionally, the passage notes that if the Russians refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them, which suggests that the two countries had different interests and that the United States was aware of the potential for conflict.\n\nBased on these clues, it seems that the relationship between the United States and the Soviets was not one of outright hostility (as suggested by option C), nor was it one of close friendship or cooperation (as suggested by option B). Instead, it seems that the two countries were working together, but with a level of tension and mistrust.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nA. Uneasy allies\n\nThis option suggests that the United States and the Soviets were working together, but with a level of discomfort or tension, which is consistent with the tone of the passage."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured.

It highlights the exploitation and abuse of Native American laborers by mine owners, including forced labor, unpaid work, and debt bondage. The passage also mentions the corruption of colonial officials, who are bribed by mine owners to ignore the mistreatment of Native Americans.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. The formal adoption of debt slavery as a means to clear debts: The passage does describe a system of debt bondage, where Native Americans are forced to work to pay off debts, but it does not suggest that this is a formally adopted system. Instead, it appears to be an informal practice used by mine owners to exploit Native American laborers.\n\nB. The absence of corruption among elites: The passage explicitly states that colonial officials are bribed by mine owners, which suggests that corruption is present among elites.\n\nC. The king's lack of interest in the welfare of Native American subjects: The passage does not provide direct evidence of the king's views or interests. However, it does suggest that the king's officials are corrupt and neglect their duties to protect Native Americans.\n\nD. The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth: The passage describes the exploitation and abuse of Native Americans by mine owners, who are often Spaniards or mestizos. This suggests that there is a social hierarchy based on origin of birth, with Native Americans at the bottom and Spaniards and mestizos at the top.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is:\n\nD. The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth.\n\nThe passage provides evidence of a social hierarchy based on origin of birth, with Native Americans being exploited and abused by those of Spanish or mestizo descent. While the passage also suggests corruption among elites and debt bondage, these are not the primary focus of the passage."}

This suggests that there is a bureaucratic system in place at the local level, with officials responsible for collecting taxes.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. The Tang Dynasty's strong bureaucracy at the local level: This option is supported by the poem, as it mentions District Officers who are responsible for collecting taxes.

This language requirement is quite specific and seems unusual, especially considering the time period and the fact that many immigrants may not have had formal education or language training.\n\nOption A, \"a concern for high educational standards in a rapidly growing society,\" seems unlikely, as the Act does not mention any other educational requirements or standards. Additionally, the focus on a single language test seems too narrow to be a genuine attempt to ensure high educational standards.\n\nOption C, \"a measure to ensure that all immigrants possessed useful expertise,\" is also unlikely, as the language test does not necessarily correlate with any specific skill or expertise.\n\nOption D, \"an attempt to bar all immigrants regardless of origin,\" is not supported by the text, as the Act specifically targets certain categories of immigrants, including those who fail the language test, rather than imposing a blanket ban.\n\nOption B, \"a tactic allowing the exclusion of non-Europeans without referring directly to race,\" seems the most plausible interpretation. The language test is specifically in a European language, which would likely disadvantage non-European immigrants who may not have had exposure to such languages. This provision may have been designed to exclude non-European immigrants without explicitly stating a racial preference, which would have been considered discriminatory.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the emphasis on language in the first passage is most safely interpreted as:\n\nB. a tactic allowing the exclusion of non-Europeans without referring directly to race."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?", "choices": ["The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India", "British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company", "Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority", "The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government"], "answer": 3, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "To determine the outcome of the events discussed in both passages, let's analyze the context and the information provided.\n\nThe passages describe the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny, which was a widespread uprising against British rule in India. The rebellion was sparked by various factors, including the introduction of the Enfield rifle, which used greased cartridges that had to be bitten open before loading, and the grease used was pig fat and beef tallow, which offended both Hindus and Muslims.\n\nThe first passage, written by British journalist William Howard Russell in 1860, highlights the brutality of the rebellion, particularly the massacres at Cawnpore (now Kanpur), and the desire of the rebels to overthrow British rule and re-establish native power.\n\nThe second passage, written by historian Rudrangshu Mukherjee in 1990, provides a more nuanced analysis of the rebellion, emphasizing the role of violence in maintaining British power in India and the ways in which the rebellion challenged that power.\n\nConsidering the historical context, we know that the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was ultimately suppressed by the British, but it led to significant changes in the way India was governed. The British government abolished the British East India Company and took direct control of India, marking the beginning of the British Raj.\n\nWith this information in mind, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India: This option is partially correct, as the British East India Company was indeed abolished, but there is no evidence to suggest that India was granted partial home rule.\n\nB. British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company: This option is incorrect, as the British East India Company was abolished, not strengthened.\n\nC. Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority: This option is incorrect, as the rebellion was ultimately suppressed, and India did not achieve full independence until 1947.\n\nD. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government: This option is correct, as the rebellion was suppressed, and the British government took direct control of India, marking the beginning of the British Raj.\n\nTherefore, the final verdict is:\n\nD. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von Füch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nAccording to the second passage, which of the following contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?", "choices": ["Interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries", "Native inexperience in hunting deep into the subarctic tundra", "Competition from Russian hunters and trappers", "Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals"], "answer": 3, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the second passage. The passage states that the natives are ruined due to the yasak tribute they are forced to pay. It mentions that initially, there were plenty of furbearing animals, but now there are no sables and not many foxes left. This suggests that the main reason for the burden faced by the natives is the depletion of the furbearing animals, which makes it difficult for them to fulfill their tribute obligations.\n\nThe passage does not mention anything about interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries (A), native inexperience in hunting (B), or competition from Russian hunters and trappers (C). Therefore, these options can be eliminated.\n\nThe correct answer is D. Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals. This is the most plausible reason for the burden faced by the natives, as it is directly mentioned in the passage as a consequence of the yasak tribute.\n\nFinal verdict: The correct answer is D."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system.

While the Columbian Exchange did introduce new crops to Africa, there is no strong evidence to suggest that these foodstuffs were primarily obtained through trade with Europeans or that they were crucial for sustaining population growth during this period.\n\nOption B proposes that Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with Europeans for firearms. This option has historical backing, as the period saw the rise and consolidation of various African states and kingdoms that were significantly influenced by the trade with Europeans, including the trade in firearms. These weapons allowed African rulers to expand their territories, consolidate power, and sometimes resist European encroachment.\n\nOption C states that Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves. While the transatlantic slave trade was a devastating and significant aspect of African-European relations during this period, saying that European merchants were the \"sole\" purchasers of slaves overlooks the complexity of African slavery and the slave trade, which also involved other buyers and was part of a broader system of labor and servitude within Africa.\n\nOption D suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty. This option simplifies the complex dynamics of African-European alliances and the varied responses of African states to European, Muslim, and Arab influences. While there were instances of alliances and conflicts, this option does not broadly represent the primary importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans during this period.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the most accurate explanation for the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. is related to the consolidation of new states and kingdoms facilitated by the trade in firearms.\n\nThe final answer is: B"}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

This suggests that the issue is related to who has the right to rule Bohemia.\n\nThe song also mentions that the Winter King will have to stay away from Rhine and Prague, and that shame and dismay will plague his days and nights. This implies that the Winter King's actions have consequences, and that he is being punished for his actions.\n\nGiven this information, the most likely underlying issue is related to the rules of royal succession. The song seems to be saying that the Winter King has usurped the throne, and that Ferdinand is the rightful king.\n\nWhile religious conflict, military stalemate, and social class conflicts may have been relevant issues in the 17th century, they are not explicitly mentioned in the song. Therefore, based on the lyrics, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nA. Rules of royal succession."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBy what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the following most likely prompted the complaint voiced in the passage?", "choices": ["British sale of opium in China", "British exports of tobacco to China", "British introduction of gunpowder to China", "British encouragement of heroin use to China"], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the passage and identify the key points.\n\nThe passage is a letter from Lin Zexu, a Chinese trade commissioner, to Queen Victoria in 1839. The tone of the letter is one of complaint and concern. The author is upset about the fact that foreigners (specifically, the British) are sending a \"poisonous drug\" to China, which is causing harm to the Chinese people.\n\nThe author mentions that opium is prohibited in the foreigners' own country, which suggests that they are aware of its harmful effects. The author also contrasts the harmful effects of opium with the beneficial effects of Chinese exports to foreign countries.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA. British sale of opium in China: This option is consistent with the content of the passage, which specifically mentions opium as the \"poisonous drug\" being sent to China.\n\nB. British exports of tobacco to China: There is no mention of tobacco in the passage, so this option is unlikely to be correct.\n\nC. British introduction of gunpowder to China: Gunpowder is not mentioned in the passage, and it is not typically considered a \"poisonous drug\".\n\nD. British encouragement of heroin use to China: Heroin is not mentioned in the passage, and it is unlikely that the author would have been aware of it in 1839, as it was not widely known or used at that time.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely answer is:\n\nA. British sale of opium in China\n\nThis answer is consistent with the content of the passage and the historical context of the time. The Opium Wars between China and Britain began in 1839, and the British sale of opium in China was a major factor leading to the conflict."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n—Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich statement most accurately compares the Mongol (post-classical) empire with the Persian (classical) empire?", "choices": ["Both the Mongols and the Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures.", "The Mongols invested in building large-scale monuments, whereas the Persians focused on public works.", "Both the Persians and the Mongols improved the social, economic, and legal status of women.", "The Mongols created a new syncretic belief system, but the Persians maintained a traditional monotheistic religion."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the given text and recall what we know about the Persian Empire.\n\nThe text states that the Mongol Empire was a vast realm where \"once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated.\" This suggests that the Mongols allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures.\n\nNow, let's consider the Persian Empire. Under the Achaemenid Empire, which was the largest empire of the ancient world, conquered peoples were also allowed to maintain their local traditions and cultures. The Persians practiced a policy of tolerance and allowed the various regions of their empire to govern themselves and maintain their own customs.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that both the Mongols and the Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures.\n\nThe final verdict is: A. Both the Mongols and the Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBut the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nMost classical empires shared which of the following traits?", "choices": ["They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.", "They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government.", "They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires.", "They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle."], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the passage and the options provided.\n\nThe passage describes the decline of the Roman Empire, attributing it to the consequences of its own greatness, including the corruption of its military and the eventual collapse under external pressures. While the passage does not explicitly describe traits common to classical empires, we can infer some characteristics from the context and our general knowledge of such empires.\n\nOption A, \"They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire,\" is not directly supported by the passage. However, classical empires often did encourage or enforce cultural assimilation to varying degrees, but this is not universally true for all classical empires.\n\nOption B, \"They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government,\" is not mentioned in the passage. While some empires did support foreign religions, this was not a universal trait among classical empires.\n\nOption C, \"They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires,\" is also not mentioned in the passage. However, it is well-known that many classical empires, including the Roman Empire, undertook extensive public works projects to facilitate integration, administration, and economic activities across their territories.\n\nOption D, \"They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle,\" is not discussed in the passage. The implementation of a merit-based bureaucracy is more characteristic of certain Chinese dynasties, like the Qin and Han, rather than being a common trait among all classical empires.\n\nGiven the information provided in the passage and general knowledge about classical empires, the most accurate answer would be related to the common practices of empires in terms of administration and infrastructure development.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

To address this issue, Mao proposes a solution: the socialist transformation of agriculture, which involves cooperative farming and the elimination of the rich-peasant economy and individual economy.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Governments in communist countries implementing liberal political and economic reforms to mitigate social unrest: This option doesn't align with Mao's proposal, as he advocates for a socialist transformation, not liberal reforms.\n\nB. Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population: This option matches Mao's proposal, as he suggests cooperative farming and the elimination of individual economies to reduce inequality.\n\nC. Governments promoting policies intended to hasten industrialization: While Mao mentions socialist industrialization, it's not the primary focus of the passage. The main concern is addressing the wealth gap in the countryside through agricultural cooperation.\n\nD. Governments promoting capitalist policies to reduce inequality between sectors of the population: This option is the opposite of Mao's proposal, as he argues against the capitalist direction and advocates for socialist transformation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?", "choices": ["How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other", "Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era", "Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.", "How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the passage and the options provided.\n\nThe passage discusses the development of gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China during the 1200s-1400s.

Europe, with its focus on siege warfare, invested in improving cannons, while China, facing mobile steppe nomads, prioritized horse archer units.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other: The passage does not discuss the sharing of technologies between societies, so this option is not a good fit.\n\nB. Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era: This option is plausible, as the passage suggests that Europe's investment in gunpowder technology may have contributed to its future military superiority.\n\nC. Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.: The passage does not mention the Silk Road or commerce, so this option is not relevant.\n\nD.

The city's economy is driven by merchants, porters, and fishermen, with some merchants being extremely wealthy and owning large ships. The journal highlights the city's strategic location, its connection to Indian trade networks, and the presence of Egyptian merchants.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Military campaigns: There is no mention of military campaigns in the journal, and it's unclear how they would directly lead to the development of the economic system described.\n\nB. Meteorological phenomena: The journal mentions the collection of rainwater in reservoirs, but this is more of a necessity due to the city's lack of natural water sources rather than a driving factor in the development of the economic system.\n\nC. Competition with European trade networks: There is no mention of European trade networks in the journal, and it's unlikely that competition with them would have directly led to the development of Aden's economic system, especially considering the time period (1325-1354 CE).\n\nD. The presence of highly developed port cities: This option seems the most plausible. The journal highlights Aden's connection to Indian ports, such as Cambay, Quilon, and Calicut, which suggests that the presence of these developed port cities facilitated trade and contributed to Aden's economic growth.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that the correct answer is:\n\nD. The presence of highly developed port cities"}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIs it not unity alone that can weld us into an effective force, capable of creating our own progress and making our valuable contribution to world peace? Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning and common endeavour.\nGhana's president, Kwame Nkrumah, addressing the Organization of African Unity, 1963\nThe speaker in the passage above is espousing which of the following causes?", "choices": ["Nationalism", "Socialism", "Pan-Africanism", "Neocolonialism"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "To determine the cause being espoused by the speaker, let's analyze the key points in the passage:\n\n1. The speaker emphasizes the need for unity to create an effective force for progress and world peace. This suggests a desire for collective action beyond individual national interests.\n2. The speaker questions whether any independent African state can claim to have its financial and banking institutions fully harnessed to its national development, implying a critique of the current state of affairs in individual nations.\n3. The speaker argues that political independence is not enough to overcome the consequences of colonial rule, suggesting that a more comprehensive approach is needed.\n4. The speaker calls for a union rooted in common purpose, planning, and endeavor, which implies a desire for cooperation and collaboration among nations.\n\nConsidering these points, the cause being espoused by the speaker appears to be focused on the unity and cooperation of African nations, rather than individual national interests or ideologies like socialism or neocolonialism.\n\nTherefore, the final verdict is:\n\nC. Pan-Africanism"}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Persians, an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation forsooth which has not directed its heart and has not entrusted its spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and fire; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion….The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months. On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.\nLet the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.\nJerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial.

In the first paragraph, he mentions the \"city of Constantinople\" and the \"horrible tale\" of a \"race from the kingdom of the Persians\" invading the lands of Christians.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\nA. The conquest of Constantinople by the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate: This event occurred in 717-718 CE, more than 300 years before Urban's speech. While it was a significant event, it's unlikely to be the direct inspiration for Urban's mention of Constantinople.\n\nB. The invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks: This event occurred in the mid-11th century, specifically in 1071 CE, when the Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantine Empire at the Battle of Manzikert. This led to the Seljuk conquest of much of Anatolia, which was a significant blow to the Byzantine Empire and a major concern for the Christian world.\n\nC. The invasion of the Balkans by the Avars and Bulgars: This event occurred in the 6th to 9th centuries CE, which is too early to be the direct inspiration for Urban's speech.\n\nD. The conversion of the people of Constantinople to Catholic Christianity: This event did not occur, as the people of Constantinople remained Eastern Orthodox Christians.\n\nConsidering the timeline and the historical context, the most likely event that inspired Urban's invocation of Constantinople is the invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks (Option B). This event was a recent and significant threat to the Byzantine Empire and the Christian world, and it would have been a pressing concern for Pope Urban II and the Catholic Church.\n\nFinal verdict: B. The invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBy what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nOn which of the following arguments does the author of the passage principally base his appeal?", "choices": ["It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.", "Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral.", "Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade.", "Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To determine which argument the author principally bases his appeal on, let's analyze the passage.\n\nThe author, Lin Zexu, is appealing to Queen Victoria to stop the export of opium to China. He argues that the British know the harm caused by opium, as evidenced by its prohibition in their own country. He then questions the morality of allowing this harmful substance to be exported to another country, particularly China.\n\nThe key sentence that reveals the author's principal argument is: \"Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country...\" This sentence suggests that the author is appealing to the principle of consistency and fairness, implying that it is hypocritical to sell a substance banned as harmful in one's own country to another country.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own. This option aligns with the author's argument, as he emphasizes the inconsistency between the British prohibition on opium in their own country and their willingness to export it to China.\n\nB. Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral. While the author may be influenced by Confucian teachings, there is no explicit mention of them in the passage.\n\nC. Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade. The passage does not mention the economic impact of opium addiction on China's trade balance.\n\nD. Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state. The passage does not contain any reference to the military power of China or the potential consequences of British actions.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nI have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n—Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nIn his letter, Martin Luther avoided speaking about which of the following topics?", "choices": ["The wealth of the church", "The power of the clergy", "The sale of indulgences", "The political nature of the church"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the content of Martin Luther's letter.\n\nLuther discusses the \"worldly pomp\" of the head of Christendom, which suggests that he is criticizing the wealth and materialism of the church (A). He also talks about the power of the clergy, specifically the Pope and cardinals, and how they have created a system to maintain their power and control (B). Additionally, Luther mentions the political nature of the church, criticizing the way the Pope and cardinals have become embroiled in worldly politics (D).\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the text, I notice that Luther does not mention the sale of indulgences (C) at all. This is surprising, given that the sale of indulgences was a major controversy at the time and a key issue that Luther would later address in his 95 Theses.\n\nTherefore, based on the content of the letter, I conclude that Martin Luther avoided speaking about the sale of indulgences.\n\nFinal verdict: C. The sale of indulgences."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAlthough in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward.\n—Robert K. Massie, Peter the Great: His Life and World\nBased on the above passage, what kinds of reforms did Peter the Great embrace?", "choices": ["Creation of an elected assembly", "Declarations of human rights", "Development of a constitutional monarchy", "Reduction of aristocratic influence"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the passage. The passage states that Peter the Great was exposed to ideas of civil and political rights, constitutions, bills of rights, and parliaments in Protestant Europe. However, it explicitly says that he did not return to Russia with the intention of sharing power with his people. This suggests that he did not adopt the ideas of creating an elected assembly, declaring human rights, or developing a constitutional monarchy, which are all associated with sharing power and limiting the monarch's authority.\n\nInstead, the passage implies that Peter the Great's reforms were more autocratic in nature, with him providing the direction and motive force for change. The mention of \"driving\" and \"flogging\" the nation forward also suggests a more coercive approach.\n\nGiven these points, none of the options A, B, or C seem to align with Peter the Great's approach to reform. Option D, \"Reduction of aristocratic influence,\" is not explicitly mentioned in the passage, but it is also not ruled out. However, since the passage does not provide any information about Peter the Great's views on aristocratic influence, we cannot conclude that this was a type of reform he embraced.\n\nBased on the information provided, the best answer would be \"None of the above,\" but since that option is not available, I will choose the least likely option to be correct.\n\nFinal verdict: D"}
