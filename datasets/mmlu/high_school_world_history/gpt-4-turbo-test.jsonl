{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?", "choices": ["They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.", "They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.", "They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.", "They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology."], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "The passage explains that the Chinese faced a specific type of military threat from highly mobile steppe nomads. Early gunpowder weapons, which were heavy and slow to fire, were not effective against these fast-moving enemies. As a result, the Chinese focused on improving their horse archer units, which were more suited to combat the nomads effectively. This strategic decision was based on the immediate military needs of China at the time, rather than a lack of resources or influence from traditionalism.\n\nOption A suggests that Confucian traditionalism discouraged innovation in gunpowder weaponry, but the passage does not mention any cultural or philosophical reasons affecting the development of military technology. Option B, which states that the Chinese put too much faith in the numerical strength of their forces, is also not supported by the text, which instead highlights a strategic choice based on the type of warfare they were engaged in. Option D, regarding the expense of converting to new military technology, is not mentioned or implied as a factor in the decision-making process described.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs. This choice is directly supported by the passage, which explains that the Chinese prioritized the development of military capabilities that were most effective against their primary threats."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"After the Tencteri came, in former days, the Bructeri; but the general account now is, that the Chamavi and Angrivarii entered their settlements, drove them out and utterly exterminated them with the common help of the [neighboring] tribes, either from hatred of their tyranny, or from the attractions of plunder, or from heaven's [favorable] regard for us. It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nThe views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Roman society?", "choices": ["Disgust for barbarian peoples", "Concern about barbarian attacks", "Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy", "Maintenance of large armies"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": -1, "completion": "The excerpt from Tacitus' \"Germania\" provides a vivid account of the Roman perspective on conflicts among the Germanic tribes. Tacitus, a Roman historian, describes how the Chamavi and Angrivarii tribes drove out and exterminated the Bructeri with the help of neighboring tribes. He expresses a distinct satisfaction that this conflict occurred under the gaze of the Romans, who delighted in the spectacle of such a large number of enemies (over sixty thousand) falling not by Roman hands but in internecine conflict.\n\nThe key to understanding the views expressed in this excerpt lies in the phrase, \"May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other.\" This statement reveals a strategic preference for discord among potential adversaries, which would weaken them and reduce their threat to Rome. This reflects a common Roman strategy of \"divide and rule,\" where the empire benefited from the disunity and internal conflicts among neighboring tribes or nations.\n\nOption A, \"Disgust for barbarian peoples,\" might initially seem plausible because of the harsh description of the conflict. However, the text does not primarily express disgust; rather, it shows a strategic appreciation of the situation.\n\nOption B, \"Concern about barbarian attacks,\" is not supported directly by the text. While the Romans were generally concerned about the security threats from barbarian tribes, this excerpt focuses more on the benefits to Rome derived from barbarian infighting rather than concern over attacks.\n\nOption C, \"Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy,\" is not relevant to the content of the excerpt. Stoicism, a philosophy advocating virtue and detachment from emotion, does not directly relate to the strategic and somewhat gleeful commentary on the conflict among tribes.\n\nOption D, \"Maintenance of large armies,\" although a characteristic of Roman society, is not the focus of this excerpt. The text does not discuss the use or maintenance of Roman armies but rather celebrates that the conflict and casualties occurred without Roman military involvement.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks\n\nThis option aligns with the strategic implications of the text, highlighting how internal discord among tribes served Roman interests by potentially reducing the threat of unified attacks against the empire."}

This legislation specifically targeted Chinese laborers, restricting their immigration into the U.S. To determine which economic activity most influenced this legislative action, we need to consider the historical context of Chinese labor in the United States during the 19th century.\n\nChinese immigrants played a significant role in several key industries in the U.S. during the 1800s. Among these were railroad construction, particularly the building of the Transcontinental Railroad, which was a monumental project that connected the eastern and western parts of the United States. Chinese laborers were integral to this project, known for their hard work and efficiency under extremely challenging conditions.\n\nWhile Chinese immigrants also worked in other sectors like mining and agriculture, the impact of their contribution to railroad construction was highly visible and often publicly acknowledged. This visibility, coupled with the scale of the project and its importance to the U.S. economy and development, likely contributed to the rising levels of immigration and subsequent labor tensions.\n\nGiven this context, option A, Railroad construction, is the most likely economic activity that drove the rising levels of immigration leading to the enactment of the Chinese Exclusion Act. This activity not only employed a large number of Chinese immigrants but also had significant economic and infrastructural impacts, making it a focal point for both support and opposition regarding Chinese labor."}

The description highlights the presence of various religious and ethnic groups, including Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks, living within distinct sections of the city, each surrounded by walls. This indicates a structured and diverse urban society.\n\nThe passage also mentions that the King of China is a Tartar, a descendant of Ghenghis Khan, suggesting the influence of the Mongol Empire in China. The Mongol Empire, known for its vast conquests across Eurasia, played a significant role in connecting different regions, facilitating trade and cultural exchanges. This connection is evident in the presence of diverse religious communities in Hangzhou, which was part of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 CE) established by the Mongols in China.\n\nGiven this context, the conclusion that is most directly supported by the passage is:\n\nC. The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the mention of the Tartar king and the diverse population in Hangzhou, which indicates the integration of various cultures and communities under the rule of the Mongol Empire. The Mongols' control over a vast territory facilitated the movement of goods, people, and ideas across different regions, thereby linking trade routes across Eurasia. This integration is a direct result of the political and military strategies of the steppe nomads, particularly the Mongols, during this period."}

In the passage, Luther criticizes the Roman Catholic Church for asserting that the spiritual power of the church is above the secular or temporal power of the state. This claim by the church was used to argue that secular rulers could not exercise jurisdiction over the church, thus protecting the church from external influence and reform.\n\nLuther's argument is aimed at challenging this separation and asserting that secular authorities should have the right to influence or reform the church, especially when it is necessary for the betterment of Christendom. Therefore, the \"temporal power\" mentioned here clearly aligns with the concept of state or secular authority, rather than any clerical, legal, scholarly, or economic authority.\n\nBased on this understanding, the correct answer is:\nC. A state or secular authority"}

This system is indicative of the encomienda system, which was practiced by the Spanish in the Americas. Under the encomienda system, Spanish encomenderos were granted the right to extract tribute and labor from the indigenous people in a particular area. In return, the encomenderos were supposed to provide protection and religious instruction. This system often led to severe exploitation and abuse of the indigenous populations.\n\nThe other options listed do not fit as well with the context provided by the quote:\nA. Slavery typically involves the ownership of individuals as property, which is distinct from the encomienda system where the relationship was more about tribute and labor in exchange for protection.\nB. Indentured servitude involves individuals voluntarily entering into a contract to work for a certain number of years in exchange for passage to a new location, room, and board, which does not align with the involuntary nature of the labor extracted under the encomienda system.\nD.

Victories against outsiders granted legitimacy to leaders of states. This option is supported by the text, as the military successes of Sanehat under the Syrian ruler's command likely enhanced the ruler's prestige and authority, both among his own people and in the eyes of other states. Military victories often serve to solidify a ruler's legitimacy by demonstrating their strength and capability to lead and protect their state.\n\nB.

However, the rise of Islam dramatically changed the political landscape. After the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 C.E., Islamic Arab forces rapidly expanded, conquering the Sasanian Empire by 651 C.E. This marked the end of the Sasanian dynasty and the incorporation of its territories into the rapidly growing Islamic Caliphate.\n\nFrom this point, Persia did not control Arabia; rather, it became part of the Islamic world, which was initially ruled from Medina and later from Damascus and Baghdad—cities that were not in Persia. The cultural and political influence during the subsequent centuries saw a significant Arab influence over Persia, particularly with the spread of Islam and the Arabic language, although Persia retained much of its cultural identity and later influenced the Islamic culture in return.\n\nThroughout the medieval period, various dynasties such as the Abbasids, based in Baghdad (which is not in present-day Iran but was part of the Persian cultural sphere), and later the Safavids, who established a distinctly Persian state in the early 16th century, shaped the region. These dynasties, while Persian in cultural orientation, were part of the broader Islamic world that included Arabia.\n\nGiven this historical overview, the most accurate description of the relationship between Persia and Arabia from 600 to 1450 C.E. is:\n\nD.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n—Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

The context indicates that both the United States and the Soviet Union were involved in determining the post-war status of Korea, but there was a clear concern about the extent of Soviet advancement.\n\nThe term \"uneasy allies\" fits this scenario best. The United States and the Soviet Union were allies during World War II, working together against common enemies such as Nazi Germany and Japan. However, the passage reflects a sense of unease or tension regarding the Soviets' intentions and movements, particularly in relation to Korea. Bonesteel's decision to propose the 38th parallel as a dividing line for surrender zones suggests a strategic move to limit Soviet influence while still cooperating within the framework of their wartime alliance.\n\nThe other options do not accurately reflect the relationship as depicted:\n- \"Comrades-in-arms\" suggests a closer, more harmonious relationship than what is described.\n- \"Mortal enemies\" is too strong, as it implies active hostility or conflict, which does not align with their status as allies at the time.\n- \"Distant strangers\" does not capture the active engagement and strategic considerations between the two nations regarding Korea.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\nA. Uneasy allies"}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year….\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays.

The text describes the severe conditions under which the indigenous people worked, including not being paid for their labor, being forced into additional unpaid tasks, and being subjected to debt through unfair trade practices. Additionally, it highlights the corruption among colonial officials and the ineffectiveness of the supposed protectors of the Indians.\n\nOption A, \"The formal adoption of debt slavery as a means to clear debts,\" is not directly supported by the text. While the passage does mention the imposition of debts on the Indians, it does not indicate that this was formally adopted as a policy for clearing debts.\n\nOption B, \"The absence of corruption among elites,\" is directly contradicted by the text, which explicitly states that colonial officials and mine owners were corrupt, often colluding to the detriment of the Native Americans.\n\nOption C, \"The king's lack of interest in the welfare of Native American subjects,\" could be inferred from the text, as it mentions that the protector of the Indians does not inform the king or the royal court about the abuses. However, the primary focus of the passage is not on the king's attitudes but rather on the actions of local officials and mine owners.\n\nOption D, \"The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth,\" is strongly supported by the text. The passage describes a system where Spaniards, mestizos, and Indian mine owners and stewards exploit the Native American workers, indicating a clear social hierarchy based on ethnic and social origins. This stratification leads to the severe mistreatment and exploitation of the indigenous population.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D, \"The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth,\" as it is most directly supported by the evidence provided in the passage."}

In the third stanza, the soldier discusses the challenges of taxation, specifically mentioning that \"The District Officers are demanding the land tax, But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!\" This statement highlights the difficulty in collecting taxes from a population burdened by constant military conscription and the resultant neglect of agricultural activities.\n\nAnalyzing the options provided:\n\nA. The Tang Dynasty's strong bureaucracy at the local level - The poem does not provide evidence of a strong bureaucracy; rather, it suggests a disconnect between the demands of the government (for taxes) and the realities of the populace (inability to pay due to military conscription and agricultural neglect).\n\nB. The Tang Dynasty's large, standing professional army with no need of conscription - The poem directly contradicts this statement, as it discusses the ongoing conscription and the long-term military service of the soldiers.\n\nC. Relatively advanced Tang agricultural technologies - The poem does not discuss agricultural technologies. It mentions that the fields are a mess and implies that agricultural productivity is low, which does not suggest advanced technologies.\n\nD. The relatively high level of urbanization in Tang China - The poem does not provide information about urbanization. It focuses on the rural issues, particularly the impact of military demands on agricultural productivity and rural life.\n\nTherefore, none of the options directly align with the evidence provided in the poem regarding taxation.

This requirement can be analyzed to determine its underlying purpose and implications.\n\nOption A suggests that the requirement is a concern for high educational standards. However, the specification of a \"European language\" rather than any language or a set of languages that includes non-European languages indicates that the requirement is not solely about educational standards.\n\nOption B posits that the language requirement is a tactic to exclude non-Europeans without directly referring to race. This interpretation aligns with the historical context of the era during which the law was enacted. The choice of European languages as a criterion effectively excludes many non-European immigrants who may not have had the opportunity or need to learn these languages, thus acting as a proxy for racial exclusion without explicit mention of race.\n\nOption C, which suggests the measure ensures all immigrants possessed useful expertise, does not directly correlate with the ability to write in a European language. Expertise in specific fields or industries is not necessarily linked to language proficiency, especially in a European language.\n\nOption D, which proposes an attempt to bar all immigrants regardless of origin, is contradicted by the specific mention of European languages, which implies that those familiar with these languages are still permissible.\n\nGiven these considerations, Option B is the most plausible interpretation. It reflects a method of indirectly controlling the racial and ethnic composition of immigrants under the guise of a language proficiency requirement, thereby excluding many non-European individuals without explicit racial discrimination. This tactic aligns with broader patterns of immigration control observed in similar historical contexts, where laws were structured to achieve racial exclusion without explicit racial references."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries.

It mentions the safety and security provided to merchants and travelers across the Mongol domains, which facilitated the movement of goods, ideas, and technologies across different regions. This indicates a strong emphasis on maintaining and promoting trade networks, which were crucial for economic and social development and for connecting various parts of the empire.\n\nOption A, \"Emphasis on trade networks,\" directly aligns with the description in the passage. The text specifically states that \"merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property,\" and that \"secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities.\" This suggests that the Mongols prioritized the establishment and security of trade routes to integrate their empire.\n\nOption B, \"Expansion of bureaucracy to reinforce dominance,\" is plausible but not directly supported by the passage. While effective administration might have been necessary for the Mongols, the text does not specifically mention the expansion of bureaucracy as a method of integration.\n\nOption C, \"The use of state-sponsored religion to legitimize the government,\" is also not supported by the passage. The text does mention the tolerance of virtually all religions, but there is no indication that religion was used strategically to legitimize Mongol rule or integrate its territories.\n\nOption D, \"Expansion of an interregional canal system,\" is not mentioned in the passage. While canal systems can play a significant role in integrating diverse geographical areas, the text does not provide any evidence that this was a method used by the Mongol empire.\n\nTherefore, the best answer, based on the information provided in the passage, is:\nA. Emphasis on trade networks."}

De Gouges highlights the injustice that persists even after societal changes, such as revolutions, where men have gained freedom and power but continue to treat women unjustly. She urges women to realize their rights and oppose the pretensions of male superiority, indicating that despite the revolutionary changes, women's conditions and rights have not been adequately addressed.\n\nThis passage supports the observation that revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality. De Gouges is pointing out that even though revolutions might lead to broader societal changes, these changes often fail to address or improve the status and rights of women. This is evident from her appeal for women to recognize their situation and fight for their rights, suggesting that the revolution did not automatically result in gender equality.\n\nOption A, \"Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality,\" is therefore the best supported by the passage. The other options do not align as closely with the content of the passage. Option B is incorrect as the passage does not suggest that women typically assume leadership roles during revolutions. Option C is also incorrect as it claims women rarely support revolutions, which is not discussed in the passage. Option D, stating that revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights, is a broader and more absolute statement than what the passage supports; the passage specifically critiques the outcomes of revolutions regarding gender equality rather than the general interest of revolutionary movements in women's rights."}

She notes that while they are now free and the war is over, their economic and social conditions have not improved; they remain poor peasants.\n\nTo determine which factor is likeliest to have prevented the progress hoped for by Halima, we need to consider the context and the specific grievances she mentions:\n\nA. Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism – While traditionalism might influence various aspects of society, Halima does not specifically mention religious or cultural traditions as a barrier to progress in her statement. Her concerns are more directly tied to economic and educational opportunities.\n\nB. Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure – This option could be a plausible reason for the lack of progress. Without sufficient industrial development or infrastructure, economic opportunities and resources necessary for significant social changes, such as widespread education, might be limited. However, Halima does not explicitly mention these factors.\n\nC. Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites – Although this could be a significant issue, Halima's statement does not specifically address women's rights or gender issues. Her focus is more on the general lack of social and economic progress.\n\nD. Prioritization of national liberation over social reform – This option directly addresses the nature of the changes that occurred after independence. Halima's statement reflects a situation where political freedom (national liberation) was achieved, but it did not translate into broader social or economic reforms that would improve the lives of ordinary people like herself. This suggests that the focus was perhaps more on achieving political independence rather than on implementing comprehensive social reforms that would address issues like education and economic inequality.\n\nGiven the information in Halima's statement, option D, \"Prioritization of national liberation over social reform,\" seems the most likely factor that prevented the sort of progress she hoped for. This option directly correlates with her observation that they gained freedom and the war ended, but their living conditions remained unchanged, indicating a possible lack of emphasis on social reforms post-independence."}

This option encompasses both the use of religion to justify armed conflict (as seen in the first passage) and the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect based on religious reverence (as seen in the second passage).

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?", "choices": ["The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India", "British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company", "Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority", "The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government"], "answer": 3, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "The passages provided discuss the events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, particularly focusing on the violence and massacres at Cawnpore. The first passage by William Howard Russell describes the revolt as a combination of servile war, religious war, race war, and a war of revenge, emphasizing the shock and horror from the perspective of the British due to the violence committed by the colonized against their colonizers. The second passage by Rudrangshu Mukherjee critiques the British monopoly on violence and the racial and civilizational hierarchies imposed by British rule in India, highlighting how the revolt challenged these structures.\n\nTo determine the short-term outcomes of these events, we need to consider the historical context and aftermath of the 1857 rebellion. The rebellion, while widespread and intense, ultimately resulted in the defeat of the Indian rebels. This defeat did not lead to the expulsion of the British or any form of Indian independence or home rule at that time. Instead, it led to significant changes in how India was governed by the British.\n\nBefore the rebellion, the British East India Company had been the primary instrument of British imperialism in India. However, the rebellion exposed the weaknesses and problems with the Company's rule. In response, the British government decided to end the Company's rule and took direct control of India. This shift marked the beginning of the British Raj, where India was administered directly by the British government through a Viceroy.\n\nGiven this historical context, the correct answer to the question about the short-term outcomes of the events discussed in the passages is:\n\nD. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government.\n\nThis option accurately reflects the historical outcome where the rebellion led to the end of the East India Company's rule and the establishment of direct British government control over India."}

His theories, which form the basis of Keynesian economics, emphasize the importance of aggregate demand for the overall health of the economy. Keynes argued that during times of low private investment and consumer spending, the government should step in to increase spending and investment to maintain employment and stabilize the economy.\n\nIn response to Otto von Bismarck's concerns about the insecurity of workers' existence due to factors like unemployment, illness, and old age, Keynes would likely see these issues as contributing to economic instability and inefficiency. Bismarck's description highlights a lack of social safety nets for workers, which could lead to decreased consumer confidence and spending, thereby reducing aggregate demand.\n\nKeynes would probably argue that government intervention could help address these insecurities by implementing policies such as unemployment benefits, health insurance, and pensions for the elderly. These measures would not only provide direct support to individuals in need but also help maintain consumer spending during economic downturns, thus stabilizing aggregate demand.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer to how Keynes would suggest society address the issues raised by Bismarck is:\n\nA. Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand."}

These regulations included the requirement for traders to register their names upon entering and exiting the city, the restriction against staying overnight in the city, and the obligation to sleep in their boats outside the town. Additionally, there was a limited number of days allowed for their stay, with penalties such as imprisonment for overstaying.\n\nThese details suggest a controlled and regulated approach to foreign trade by the Ming authorities. The requirement to register names and the restriction on overnight stays in the city indicate a desire to monitor and control the movements of foreigners closely. This would help in limiting their influence and interactions within the city, thereby reducing potential social and political disruptions. The limited duration of stay and the specific requirement to sleep outside the town further emphasize the Ming Dynasty's cautious approach towards foreign traders, likely aimed at minimizing their impact on local society and culture.\n\nOption A, which suggests that the Ming Dynasty was very supportive and welcoming to all commercial enterprises, does not align with the restrictive measures described. Option C, which posits that the Ming Dynasty was too preoccupied with pirates to focus on merchant activity, is not supported by the detailed and specific regulations imposed on traders. Option D, which claims that only Portugal was allowed to trade through Canton with one boat a year, is overly specific and not substantiated by the text, which does not mention exclusivity or the number of boats allowed.\n\nTherefore, the most supported inference is option B: The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease the collection of taxes. This option aligns with the described measures aimed at controlling and limiting the activities and interactions of foreign traders within China."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

Mao's primary concern, as outlined in the passage, is the polarization of the countryside due to the unchecked growth of capitalist tendencies among the peasants. He advocates for the socialist transformation of agriculture to prevent the rich from getting richer and the poor from getting poorer, aiming for a scenario where \"all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.\"\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The development of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China. While SEZs did indeed stimulate economic growth, primarily in urban and coastal areas, this option does not directly address the agricultural transformation or the rural economic disparities Mao was concerned about. SEZs focused more on industrial and commercial development rather than agricultural reform.\n\nB. Political friction with the Soviet Union pushed China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War. This option focuses on international relations and geopolitical alignments rather than internal agricultural policies or the economic conditions of the rural peasantry.\n\nC. The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry. This option directly relates to Mao's agricultural policies, specifically mentioning the negative outcomes of these policies—famine and poverty among the peasantry, which is the exact opposite of Mao's hope for all rural people becoming increasingly well off together.\n\nD. Opposition voices in the Communist Party led by men such as Deng Xiaoping were rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution. This option pertains to political purges within the Communist Party and does not directly address the economic conditions of the peasantry or the success of agricultural policies.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C most directly undermines the hopes expressed by Mao. The negative outcomes of the agricultural cooperatives and the emphasis on steel production in the countryside, which led to famine and poverty, directly contradict Mao's goal of improving the well-being of all rural people through socialist transformation. This option highlights the failure of the policies Mao advocated for in achieving their intended results."}

The soldier's narrative in the poem highlights the continuous drafting of men for military service, the impact on agricultural productivity, and the ongoing violence and bloodshed at the frontier garrisons. This suggests a scenario where the Tang Dynasty was engaged in prolonged military efforts to control or influence frontier regions.\n\nOption A, which suggests reliance on adroit diplomacy and the establishment of client relationships with bordering nomads, does not align closely with the content of the poem. The poem does not mention diplomatic efforts or alliances but focuses on the hardships of military campaigns.\n\nOption B, which points to the ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier to impose his will, aligns more closely with the poem's depiction of ongoing military campaigns and the use of force in frontier areas. The reference to the Martial Emperor's unfulfilled territorial ambitions further supports the idea of military projection as a key strategy.\n\nOption C, regarding the permanent settlement of Han Chinese in frontier zones, is not directly supported by the poem. While the poem does mention the neglect of agricultural fields due to the absence of men, it does not specifically discuss settlement policies.\n\nOption D, involving the payment of tribute to nomadic rulers, is also not supported by the poem. The text does not mention any tribute being paid to maintain peace or relations with nomadic groups.\n\nTherefore, based on the poem and the historical context of the Tang Dynasty's military engagements on its frontiers, the most fitting answer is:\n\nB.

That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians.

The tribute required them to pay in sables, red foxes, or cash. The passage highlights that initially, there were plenty of furbearing animals available for hunting to meet these tribute demands. However, over time, the passage notes a significant depletion in the population of these animals: \"there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands.\"\n\nThis depletion of key resources directly impacted the natives' ability to fulfill their tribute obligations, as the primary means of payment was through the provision of these furbearing animals. The passage also mentions that almost half of the natives could not hunt because they no longer had horses, which were essential for hunting, further exacerbating their difficulties.\n\nGiven this information, the most significant factor contributing to the burden faced by the native Siberians in fulfilling their tribute obligations was the overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals. This depletion made it increasingly difficult for them to meet the demands of the tribute, directly affecting their economic and social stability.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?", "choices": ["Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.", "Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.", "Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.", "Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty."], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To determine the best explanation for the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans during the period 1450 to 1750 C.E., we need to consider the historical context and the nature of interactions between Europeans and Africans during this time.\n\nOption A suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants for the importation of New World foodstuffs to sustain population growth. While it is true that new crops from the Americas, such as maize and cassava, were introduced to Africa and became important in African agriculture, the statement that Africans relied on Europeans to sustain population growth through these imports is an exaggeration. African agricultural practices and local crops continued to play a crucial role in sustaining the population.\n\nOption B states that Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with Europeans for firearms. This option has historical merit as the trade in firearms was indeed significant. European firearms were introduced into African military and political systems, altering balances of power and enabling some states to expand and consolidate power more effectively. This trade was a crucial aspect of interaction with Europeans and had a lasting impact on political developments in the region.\n\nOption C claims that Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves. While the slave trade was a significant aspect of the European-African interaction, it is not accurate to say that Europeans were the sole purchasers of slaves. Internal and trans-Saharan slave trades were also significant, and slaves were traded among African communities and with Middle Eastern traders long before and alongside the transatlantic slave trade.\n\nOption D suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty. There is limited evidence to support this as a widespread or dominant reason for the importance of European contacts. While specific instances of alliances may have occurred, they were not the primary or most significant aspect of the European-African interaction during this period.\n\nGiven these considerations, Option B is the best answer as it accurately reflects a significant and transformative aspect of the European-African interaction during the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. The trade in firearms had a profound impact on the political and military dynamics within Sub-Saharan Africa, facilitating the consolidation and expansion of states and kingdoms."}

The rural peasantry - Historically, the rural peasantry in Russia and later the Soviet Union made up a large portion of the population. Prior to the Soviet era, literacy rates among this group were very low as education was not widely accessible, especially in rural areas. The significant increase in literacy rates from 24% in 1897 to nearly 100% by 1955 would have had a profound impact on this group, enabling better access to information, improved agricultural practices through reading and education, and greater participation in political and social life.\n\nB. Members of the Russian Orthodox clergy - While literacy is important for clergy members, the Russian Orthodox clergy were likely to have been literate even before the widespread educational reforms, as their roles required reading religious texts and performing liturgical duties. Therefore, the increase in literacy rates would not have as transformative an impact on this group compared to others.\n\nC. The urban middle class - This group was likely to have higher literacy rates even at the beginning of the period in question, as urban areas typically had better access to education. While improvements in literacy would have benefited them, particularly in terms of better job opportunities and access to information, the impact would not be as dramatic as on the rural peasantry.\n\nD. Officers in the armed forces - Literacy is certainly beneficial for officers for operational and strategic planning. However, like the clergy, officers would generally have been expected to be literate even before these improvements in literacy rates. Thus, the direct benefit from rising literacy rates would be less significant than for the rural peasantry.\n\nGiven these considerations, the rural peasantry (A) would probably have benefited most from the rising literacy rates, as this improvement represented a fundamental change in their lives, providing them with new opportunities for economic advancement, social mobility, and political participation that were previously inaccessible due to their lack of literacy."}

Option B, about undertaking a program of conquest in the Pacific, also does not align with the need to modernize in response to external technological and military pressures. Option D, suggesting that Japan turned inward and closed its ports to all foreigners, is historically inaccurate for this period as it describes an earlier policy of sakoku, or closed country, which was already being challenged by the time of Lord Ii's letter.\n\nOption C, which states that the country sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry, aligns with the historical response known as the Meiji Restoration.

This option suggests that Mongol administration in Russia was only tolerant of Orthodox Christianity, while in China, they favored many religious traditions. The excerpt indeed highlights the religious diversity and tolerance in Mongol-administered China, mentioning Muslims, Jews, Christians, and other groups living in distinct quarters of Hangzhou. However, historical records indicate that the Mongols were generally tolerant of various religions in their Russian domains as well, not exclusively Orthodox Christianity. Thus, this statement is not entirely accurate.\n\nB. This option states that Mongol rule in Russia relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while in China, the Mongols emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state. This is accurate. In Russia, the Mongols imposed a tribute system (yasa) but largely allowed local rulers to govern, as long as they paid tribute and maintained order. In contrast, in China, especially under Kublai Khan, the Mongols adopted many elements of the traditional Chinese bureaucratic system to administer the vast and populous region more effectively. This included the use of Chinese administrative practices and personnel.\n\nC. This option suggests that Mongol rule was viewed favorably by its subjects in Russia, while in China, it encountered immense domestic unrest. Historical evidence does not support this view. In both regions, Mongol rule was met with resistance and resentment at various times, though there were periods of stability and even prosperity under Mongol governance.\n\nD. This option claims that Mongol rule stimulated Russian export of trade goods to China, while in China, Mongol administration intentionally curtailed Chinese economic activity. There is no substantial evidence to support the claim that the Mongols curtailed Chinese economic activities; in fact, under Mongol rule, trade across the entire empire, including China, was generally promoted. The Silk Road and other trade routes flourished during this period, facilitating trade across Asia, including between Russia and China.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\nB. relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while the Mongol administration in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state."}

This approach was part of his broader strategy to stabilize the newly unified German state and prevent the rise of socialism and labor unrest by providing state-sponsored support to workers.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nA. Development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe - Bismarck's initiatives, such as health insurance, accident insurance, and old age pensions, were pioneering social welfare measures. These programs not only addressed the grievances mentioned in his speech but also set a precedent that influenced social policy in other European countries.\n\nB.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n—Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich statement most accurately compares the Mongol (post-classical) empire with the Persian (classical) empire?", "choices": ["Both the Mongols and the Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures.", "The Mongols invested in building large-scale monuments, whereas the Persians focused on public works.", "Both the Persians and the Mongols improved the social, economic, and legal status of women.", "The Mongols created a new syncretic belief system, but the Persians maintained a traditional monotheistic religion."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "To determine which statement most accurately compares the Mongol Empire with the Persian Empire, we need to analyze each option in the context of historical facts about both empires.\n\nA. Both the Mongols and the Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures.\n- This statement is accurate. The Mongols, under leaders like Chinggis Khan, were known for their religious tolerance and for allowing conquered peoples to maintain their own traditions and cultures as long as they did not rebel. Similarly, the Persian Empire, particularly under the Achaemenid rulers like Cyrus the Great, was noted for its policy of tolerance towards the customs and religions of the diverse groups within its vast empire.\n\nB. The Mongols invested in building large-scale monuments, whereas the Persians focused on public works.\n- This statement is not accurate. The Mongols are not particularly known for building large-scale monuments; their contributions were more in the realms of administration and military organization. On the other hand, the Persians are famous for both monumental architecture (like Persepolis) and significant public works (such as the Royal Road and the qanat irrigation systems).\n\nC. Both the Persians and the Mongols improved the social, economic, and legal status of women.\n- This statement is not entirely accurate. While there were instances where women in both empires held significant roles, systematic improvement in the status of women across social, economic, and legal spheres is not prominently documented, especially in the Persian Empire.\n\nD. The Mongols created a new syncretic belief system, but the Persians maintained a traditional monotheistic religion.\n- This statement is incorrect. The Mongols did not create a new syncretic belief system; they were known for their religious tolerance and inclusivity, allowing multiple religions to coexist. The Persian Empire, particularly during the Achaemenid period, was influenced by Zoroastrianism but was also known for its tolerance of other religions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate statement is:\nA. Both the Mongols and the Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures. This reflects the historical approach both empires took towards governance and cultural integration."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBut the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nMost classical empires shared which of the following traits?", "choices": ["They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.", "They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government.", "They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires.", "They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle."], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "To determine which trait was most commonly shared among classical empires, we need to analyze each option in the context of historical examples from various empires such as the Roman, Persian, and Chinese empires.\n\nA. **Cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire** - While some empires, like the Roman, allowed for a degree of cultural assimilation, they often maintained a level of diversity and did not strictly require assimilation as a policy. The Roman Empire, for instance, is known for its relatively tolerant approach to various cultures and religions within its borders.\n\nB. **State support of foreign religions to improve support of the government** - This was not a common trait among most classical empires. While some, like the Persian Empire under Cyrus the Great, did show tolerance and even support for local religions to maintain stability and support, it was not a universal policy among all empires.\n\nC. **Widespread public works projects to integrate their empires** - This is a trait seen in many classical empires. The Roman Empire, for example, built roads, aqueducts, and other infrastructure projects across its territories. Similarly, the Persian Empire under Darius improved the Royal Road and other communication networks. These projects helped integrate disparate regions, facilitate military movement, and promote economic integration.\n\nD. **Government bureaucracies based on the merit principle** - While the Han Dynasty in China is a notable example of a bureaucracy based on merit (through the use of civil service exams), this was not a common feature across all classical empires. Many empires, including the Roman, often based bureaucratic appointments more on social status, familial connections, or military achievements rather than merit alone.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most common trait among classical empires, as supported by historical evidence, is **C. They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires**. This approach not only helped in maintaining control over vast territories but also in promoting economic and cultural integration within the empires."}

A diamond rush ensued following the discovery of diamonds on Zulu lands.\n\nThe reasoning behind this choice is based on historical events surrounding the influx of Europeans into Zulu lands during the late 19th century. In 1867, diamonds were discovered in what is now South Africa, particularly near Kimberley, which led to a significant influx of Europeans seeking wealth and opportunities, known as the diamond rush. This event is a well-documented catalyst for European migration to the region, as people moved in hopes of mining fortunes.\n\nOption A suggests incentives offered by the British crown, but there is no specific historical evidence that incentives were offered specifically in 1867 for settling in Zulu lands. Option B, regarding the Zulu creating trade ports, does not align with historical accounts as the Zulu were more focused on maintaining their kingdom's integrity rather than developing trade ports for European use. Option C refers to the Berlin Conference, which occurred later, in 1884-1885, and thus does not pertain to the movements in 1867.\n\nTherefore, the discovery of diamonds and the subsequent diamond rush is the most plausible explanation for why European citizens moved in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

Mao emphasizes the need for a socialist transformation of agriculture, alongside the socialist industrialization of other sectors, to prevent the aggravation of this polarization and to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. This transformation includes the implementation of cooperative farming and the elimination of the rich-peasant economy and individual economies in the countryside.\n\nThe key elements in the quotation are the focus on preventing the division between different classes of peasants and the emphasis on socialist policies as a solution to the emerging problems caused by capitalist tendencies. Mao argues against the capitalist road and promotes a shift towards socialism through cooperative farming.\n\nGiven these points, the best context for understanding Mao's quotation is:\n\nB. Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population.\n\nThis option directly addresses the core of Mao's argument, which is the need for collectivization (or cooperative farming) as a means to address and reduce the inequalities emerging in the countryside due to capitalist practices. This aligns with the socialist transformation of agriculture that Mao advocates. The other options either do not directly address the issue of land and agriculture (C), suggest a capitalist solution (D), or imply liberal reforms which are contrary to Mao's socialist approach (A)."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals.

Charles Dickens, in the excerpt from \"A Tale of Two Cities,\" presents a complex and paradoxical view of the French Revolution. He uses a series of contrasting statements: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,\" \"it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,\" and so on. This suggests a deeply ambivalent attitude towards the events of the Revolution, recognizing both the positive and negative aspects simultaneously. Dickens acknowledges the chaos and despair (\"the winter of despair\") as well as the hope and potential (\"the spring of hope\") that characterized the period. His description does not lean entirely towards optimism or pessimism but rather portrays a nuanced, perhaps cynical view of the human condition during revolutionary times.\n\n2. William Wordsworth, in the excerpt from \"The Prelude,\" expresses a clear and straightforward sentiment about the French Revolution. His words, \"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven,\" indicate a highly positive and enthusiastic perspective. Wordsworth celebrates the revolutionary spirit and the sense of renewal and possibility that it brought. His use of the words \"bliss\" and \"heaven\" underscores a profound sense of joy and optimism about the changes occurring during that time.\n\nGiven this analysis, the adjectives that best describe Dickens's and Wordsworth's views on the French Revolution are:\n- Dickens: Cynical (reflecting his skeptical and multifaceted view of the revolution)\n- Wordsworth: Enthusiastic (reflecting his joyful and optimistic embrace of the revolutionary changes)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC.

She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms. Accordingly undertake this journey for the remission of your sins, with the assurance of the imperishable glory of the kingdom of heaven.\"\nPope Urban II, Speech at the Council of Clermont as recorded by Robert the Monk, 1095 C.E.\nWhich of the following events most directly inspired Urban's invocation of Constantinople in the first paragraph?", "choices": ["The conquest of Constantinople by the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate", "The invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks", "The invasion of the Balkans by the Avars and Bulgars", "The conversion of the people of Constantinople to Catholic Christianity"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "The correct answer is B. The invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks.\n\nTo determine which event most directly inspired Pope Urban II's reference to Constantinople in his speech, we need to consider the historical context and the specific details mentioned in the speech. The speech refers to a \"race from the kingdom of the Persians\" that has invaded the lands of Christians, leading to widespread destruction and the appropriation of churches. This description aligns with the historical events involving the Seljuk Turks, who originated from near the Persian regions and expanded into Byzantine territory, particularly Anatolia.\n\nOption A, the conquest of Constantinople by the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate, is incorrect because the Abbasids did not conquer Constantinople. Option C, the invasion of the Balkans by the Avars and Bulgars, also does not fit the description as it refers to different groups and an earlier period. Option D, the conversion of the people of Constantinople to Catholic Christianity, is unrelated to the military and territorial concerns expressed in the speech.\n\nThe Seljuk Turks' invasion of Anatolia significantly threatened the Byzantine Empire, leading to the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 where the Byzantines suffered a devastating defeat. This event led to the loss of much of Anatolia and prompted the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos to seek military assistance from the West, which in turn was one of the catalysts for Pope Urban II's call to the Crusades at the Council of Clermont. Thus, the invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks is the event that most directly inspired Urban's invocation of Constantinople in the first paragraph of his speech."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBy what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nOn which of the following arguments does the author of the passage principally base his appeal?", "choices": ["It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.", "Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral.", "Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade.", "Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state."], "answer": 0, "model_answer": 0, "completion": "The author of the passage, Lin Zexu, is addressing the issue of opium trade between Britain and China. He points out that opium is strictly prohibited in Britain due to its harmful effects, yet Britain continues to export it to China. This discrepancy forms the basis of his argument, highlighting the hypocrisy of allowing the export of a substance recognized as harmful in one's own country to another country. Lin Zexu appeals to the moral and ethical responsibility by questioning the absence of conscience in allowing such trade practices that harm another nation while protecting one's own from the same harm.\n\nOption A, \"It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own,\" directly aligns with Lin Zexu's argument. He emphasizes the inconsistency and moral failing in Britain's actions regarding the opium trade. The other options, such as Confucian teachings (B), the impact on trade balance (C), and the risk of military retaliation (D), are not discussed in the passage. Therefore, the principal basis of Lin Zexu's appeal is the hypocrisy in the trade practices concerning opium, making option A the correct answer."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nI have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n—Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nIn his letter, Martin Luther avoided speaking about which of the following topics?", "choices": ["The wealth of the church", "The power of the clergy", "The sale of indulgences", "The political nature of the church"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "In the provided excerpt from Martin Luther's \"Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation,\" Luther discusses several critical issues concerning the state of the Church and its leadership. He mentions the excessive wealth and worldly pomp of the Church leaders, specifically pointing out how the head of Christendom lives in luxury that surpasses that of kings and emperors. This addresses option A, the wealth of the church.\n\nLuther also critiques the power structure within the Church, particularly the control exerted by the Pope over interpreting scriptures and calling councils. This critique directly relates to the power of the clergy, addressing option B.\n\nRegarding option D, the political nature of the church, Luther touches on this when he discusses the creation of cardinals as a means to secure wealth and power, indicating the Church's involvement in political maneuvers to maintain and enhance its influence.\n\nHowever, in this specific excerpt, there is no mention of the sale of indulgences, which was another significant issue Luther addressed in other texts, notably his 95 Theses. The sale of indulgences involved the Church's practice of selling remissions from penance or afterlife punishments, which is not discussed in the provided passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. The sale of indulgences."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAlthough in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward.\n—Robert K. Massie, Peter the Great: His Life and World\nBased on the above passage, what kinds of reforms did Peter the Great embrace?", "choices": ["Creation of an elected assembly", "Declarations of human rights", "Development of a constitutional monarchy", "Reduction of aristocratic influence"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "The passage describes Peter the Great's approach to transforming Russia after observing the political and civil rights in Protestant Europe. It highlights that despite being exposed to new civil and political rights, such as constitutions and parliaments, Peter the Great did not intend to share power with his people or implement similar democratic reforms in Russia. Instead, he was determined to change the country through his own leadership, using education, persuasion, and, if necessary, coercion.\n\nThe passage does not mention Peter the Great embracing reforms related to the creation of an elected assembly (A), declarations of human rights (B), or the development of a constitutional monarchy (C). Instead, it suggests that he was focused on leading and possibly imposing changes himself, without distributing power or creating democratic structures.\n\nThe closest option that aligns with the passage is (D) Reduction of aristocratic influence. Although not explicitly stated, the context implies that Peter the Great was focused on centralizing power and leading reforms himself, which could involve reducing the influence of the aristocracy to ensure that changes were implemented according to his vision. This interpretation fits with his historical efforts to modernize Russia and consolidate power, often at the expense of traditional aristocratic privileges.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Reduction of aristocratic influence."}
