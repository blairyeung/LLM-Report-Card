{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?", "choices": ["They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.", "They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.", "They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.", "They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology."], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the passage and the options provided.\n\nThe passage states that China was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, and early gunpowder weapons were not effective against them due to their unwieldiness. As a result, China focused on improving its horse archer units, which were better suited to combat this type of enemy.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. The passage does not mention Confucian traditionalism as a factor in China's decision not to lead in gunpowder innovation. This option is not supported by the text.\n\nB. The passage does not suggest that China put too much faith in the numerical strength of its existing armed forces. This option is also not supported by the text.\n\nC. This option aligns with the passage, which states that China logically decided to develop weapons better suited to its immediate military needs, i.e., combating highly mobile steppe nomads.\n\nD. The passage does not mention that China could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology. This option is not supported by the text.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"After the Tencteri came, in former days, the Bructeri; but the general account now is, that the Chamavi and Angrivarii entered their settlements, drove them out and utterly exterminated them with the common help of the [neighboring] tribes, either from hatred of their tyranny, or from the attractions of plunder, or from heaven's [favorable] regard for us. It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes.

The author, Tacitus, seems to take pleasure in the fact that the conflict occurred without Roman involvement, stating that it was a \"spectacle\" and that the tribes' discord is a \"boon\" to the Roman Empire.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\nA. Disgust for barbarian peoples: While the excerpt does describe the conflict between the tribes in a somewhat detached and even celebratory tone, it doesn't necessarily convey disgust for the barbarian peoples themselves. The focus is more on the benefits of their discord for the Roman Empire.\n\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks: This option seems plausible, as the excerpt mentions the \"tyranny\" of the Bructeri and the fact that the Roman Empire benefits from the discord among the tribes. This suggests that the Romans are aware of the potential threat posed by these tribes and are relieved that they are fighting among themselves.\n\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy: Stoicism was a philosophical school that emphasized reason, self-control, and indifference to external events. The excerpt's tone, which takes pleasure in the conflict and the extermination of the Bructeri, does seem to contradict Stoic values. However, it's not clear whether this is evidence of the absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy as a whole.\n\nD. Maintenance of large armies: The excerpt doesn't mention the maintenance of large armies at all. In fact, it notes that the conflict occurred without Roman involvement, which suggests that the Roman Empire may not have needed to deploy its armies in this case.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer is B. Concern about barbarian attacks. The excerpt suggests that the Roman Empire is aware of the potential threat posed by the tribes and is relieved that they are fighting among themselves, which implies a concern about barbarian attacks."}

The act specifically targets Chinese laborers, suggesting that the driving force behind the rising levels of immigration was related to labor-intensive industries.\n\nAmong the options provided, railroad construction (A) is a strong candidate. The construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad in the United States, completed in 1869, relied heavily on Chinese laborers. The project required a large workforce to build the railroad across the western United States, and many Chinese immigrants were recruited to work on the project.\n\nWhile fertilizer harvesting (B) and sugarcane production (C) may have required labor, there is no significant historical evidence to suggest that these industries drove the large-scale immigration of Chinese laborers to the United States during this period.\n\nGold mining (D) is also a possibility, as the California Gold Rush of the mid-19th century did attract many Chinese immigrants. However, the gold rush was a more individualized and decentralized activity, whereas railroad construction was a large-scale, labor-intensive project that required a significant workforce.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most likely economic activity that drove the rising levels of immigration leading to the enactment of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 is railroad construction.\n\nFinal verdict: A. Railroad construction."}

This implies a system of labor where the Indians are obligated to work for the nobleman, likely in exchange for protection or other forms of compensation.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\nA. Slavery: While slavery did exist in the Americas during the time period, the phrase \"his Indians\" suggests a more nuanced relationship between the nobleman and the Indians. Slavery typically implies a complete loss of freedom and autonomy, which may not be the case here.\n\nB. Indentured servitude: This system involved a contract between two parties, where one party would work for the other in exchange for passage to the Americas or other forms of compensation. However, the quote does not suggest a contractual agreement between the nobleman and the Indians.\n\nC. The encomienda system: This system, established by the Spanish in the Americas, granted land and the labor of the indigenous people to Spanish nobles in exchange for their loyalty and military service. The nobles were responsible for protecting the Indians and providing them with Christian instruction, but in return, the Indians were required to work for the nobles. This system seems to match the context of the quote.\n\nD. The apprentice system: This system involved a young person learning a trade or skill from an experienced craftsman.

This implies that the institution he serves is associated with direct rule by the crown, as the British government is exercising control over India through its appointed officials.\n\nThe second passage is written by George Simpson, the Head of the Northern Department of the Hudson's Bay Company. The Hudson's Bay Company was a chartered company, which means that it was granted a royal charter to trade and govern in certain territories. This suggests that the institution Simpson serves is associated with the chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits.\n\nConsidering these points, it appears that the correct answer is D. The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits. This is because the Hudson's Bay Company is a chartered company, and the British government's rule in India during the time of William Bentinck was also facilitated by the East India Company, which was another chartered company.\n\nTherefore, the final verdict is:\n\nD. The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n—Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

The tone of the passage suggests that the United States is trying to negotiate a surrender arrangement with the Soviets, but is also wary of the Soviets' intentions and capabilities.\n\nThe passage states that Bonesteel knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive, and that the United States would be unable to stop them if they refused to confine their advance to north Korea. This suggests that the United States is concerned about the Soviets' military power and is trying to find a way to limit their influence in Korea.\n\nThe passage also describes the relationship between the United States and the Soviets as one of cautious negotiation, with Bonesteel trying to compose a surrender arrangement that would be acceptable to both parties. This suggests that the two countries are not openly hostile, but are rather engaged in a delicate diplomatic dance.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best description of the relationship between the United States and the Soviets as depicted in the passage is \"uneasy allies.\" This term captures the sense of cautious cooperation and mutual wariness that pervades the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.

It also highlights the corruption among colonial officials, who are bribed by mine owners and fail to protect the interests of the Native Americans.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. The formal adoption of debt slavery as a means to clear debts: While the passage mentions that Native Americans are forced to accept goods at their own expense and are deducted from their labor, it does not explicitly state that debt slavery is a formally adopted practice. However, it does suggest that Native Americans are being exploited and forced into debt, which is a form of debt slavery.\n\nB. The absence of corruption among elites: This option is clearly contradicted by the passage, which describes the corruption among colonial officials and mine owners.\n\nC. The king's lack of interest in the welfare of Native American subjects: The passage does not provide direct evidence of the king's lack of interest in the welfare of Native Americans. In fact, the author is addressing the king and appealing to him to take action to protect the Native Americans.\n\nD. The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth: While the passage does describe the exploitation of Native Americans by Spanish and mestizo elites, it does not explicitly state that social stratification is based on origin of birth. However, it does suggest that there is a clear social hierarchy, with Native Americans at the bottom.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is A. The formal adoption of debt slavery as a means to clear debts. The passage provides evidence of the exploitation of Native Americans through forced labor and debt, which is a form of debt slavery. While the other options are not entirely accurate, option A is the most supported by the passage."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?", "choices": ["The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India", "British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company", "Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority", "The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government"], "answer": 3, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided in the passages.\n\nThe first passage by William Howard Russell describes the Cawnpore massacres as a brutal act committed by Indian rebels against British civilians, including women and children. The passage suggests that the Indian rebels were motivated by a desire to shake off British rule and re-establish their own power and authority.\n\nThe second passage by Rudrangshu Mukherjee provides a broader context for the events of 1857, describing the British presence in India as a violent and oppressive force that maintained its power through a monopoly on violence. The passage suggests that the Indian revolt was a response to this oppression and a challenge to British authority.\n\nGiven this context, it is likely that the short-term outcome of the events discussed in the passages was a British victory over the Indian rebels, rather than an Indian military success or the attainment of independence. The British East India Company was actually dissolved in 1858, and the British government took direct control of India, imposing its own rule and authority.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work.

This option is consistent with Keynes' economic theories, which emphasize the need for government intervention to stabilize the economy and address issues like unemployment and poverty.\n\nB. Keynes would suggest helping elderly workers, but claim that the government should not intervene in most circumstances. This option is partially correct, as Keynes might support helping elderly workers, but it contradicts his general advocacy for government intervention in the economy.\n\nC. Keynes would caution against government intervention in personal economic matters. This option is incorrect, as Keynes was a proponent of government intervention in the economy to address issues like poverty and unemployment.\n\nD. Keynes would advocate doing nothing because he felt poverty in rural areas was actually more severe than it was in cities.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?", "choices": ["Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.", "Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.", "Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.", "Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty."], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the given text and the options provided.\n\nThe text by Walter Rodney suggests that European imperialism and capitalism played a significant role in African underdevelopment. It mentions that European capitalists exploited Africa's resources and made it difficult for the continent to develop rapidly.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\nA. This option is incorrect because the text does not mention anything about European merchants importing New World foodstuffs to sustain population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nB. This option is plausible because the text mentions that European capitalists exploited Africa's resources. It is likely that Sub-Saharan Africans traded with Europeans for firearms, which could have helped them consolidate new states and kingdoms.\n\nC. This option is incorrect because the text does not suggest that European merchants were the sole purchasers of slaves. In fact, the text implies that European capitalists exploited Africa's resources, including its people, but it does not provide evidence that they were the only ones involved in the slave trade.\n\nD. This option is incorrect because the text does not mention anything about Sub-Saharan Africans allying with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most plausible option is B.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road.

A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?", "choices": ["How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other", "Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era", "Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.", "How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion"], "answer": 1, "model_answer": 1, "completion": "To determine which large-scale question about global history the argument in the passage most closely relates to, let's analyze the content of the passage and the options provided.\n\nThe passage discusses the development and use of gunpowder weaponry in Western Europe and China during the 1200s to 1400s.

This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country...\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nI have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n—Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nIn his letter, Martin Luther avoided speaking about which of the following topics?", "choices": ["The wealth of the church", "The power of the clergy", "The sale of indulgences", "The political nature of the church"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 2, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the text and see which topics Martin Luther discussed.\n\n* The wealth of the church: Luther mentions the \"worldly pomp\" of the Pope and the wealth of the cardinals, so this topic is discussed (A).\n* The power of the clergy: Luther talks about the three walls that the Romanists have built around themselves, including the idea that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope, and that no one may call a council but the Pope. This suggests that he is discussing the power of the clergy (B).\n* The sale of indulgences: This topic is not mentioned in the text. Luther does mention the distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, but he does not specifically mention the sale of indulgences (C).\n* The political nature of the church: Luther discusses the temporal power of the church and the way that the Pope and cardinals have accumulated wealth and power, so this topic is also discussed (D).\n\nTherefore, based on the text, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The sale of indulgences"}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAlthough in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward.\n—Robert K. Massie, Peter the Great: His Life and World\nBased on the above passage, what kinds of reforms did Peter the Great embrace?", "choices": ["Creation of an elected assembly", "Declarations of human rights", "Development of a constitutional monarchy", "Reduction of aristocratic influence"], "answer": 2, "model_answer": 3, "completion": "To answer this question, let's analyze the passage. The passage states that Peter the Great was surrounded by evidence of new civil and political rights in Protestant Europe, including constitutions, bills of rights, and parliaments. However, it also states that he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. Instead, he believed that he must provide the direction and motive force for transforming Russia, and was willing to use force if necessary.\n\nGiven this information, it's unlikely that Peter the Great would have embraced reforms that limited his own power or increased the power of the people. Options A, B, and C all suggest reforms that would have done just that. Option A, the creation of an elected assembly, would have given the people a greater say in government. Option B, declarations of human rights, would have established certain rights and freedoms for individuals. Option C, the development of a constitutional monarchy, would have limited the power of the monarch and established a system of checks and balances.\n\nOption D, the reduction of aristocratic influence, is a more plausible answer. The passage suggests that Peter the Great was determined to transform Russia and was willing to use force to do so. Reducing the influence of the aristocracy would have been a way for him to consolidate power and achieve his goals, rather than sharing power with others.\n\nTherefore, based on the passage, the most likely answer is:\n\nD. Reduction of aristocratic influence"}
