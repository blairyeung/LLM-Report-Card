After making the maximum number of Oreo cheesecakes he can with the ingredients he bought, how many boxes of Graham crackers would he have left over?", "solution": "Lionel has enough Graham crackers to make 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 Oreo cheesecakes\nLionel has enough Oreos to make 15/3 = <<15/3=5>>5 Oreo cheesecakes\nTherefore, the maximum number of cheesecakes Lionel can make is 5.\nLionel needs 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 boxes of Graham crackers to make 4 cheesecakes\nHe'll have 14 - 10 = <<14-10=4>>4 boxes left over\n#### 4", "answer": "4", "completion": "To determine how many Oreo cheesecakes Lionel can make and how many boxes of Graham crackers will be left over, we need to consider the requirements for each cheesecake and the total ingredients Lionel has.\n\nEach Oreo cheesecake requires:\n- 2 boxes of Graham crackers\n- 3 packets of Oreos\n\nLionel bought:\n- 14 boxes of Graham crackers\n- 15 packets of Oreos\n\nFirst, we calculate the maximum number of cheesecakes Lionel can make based on each ingredient separately:\n- Based on Graham crackers: \\( \\frac{14 \\text{ boxes}}{2 \\text{ boxes per cheesecake}} = 7 \\text{ cheesecakes} \\)\n- Based on Oreos: \\( \\frac{15 \\text{ packets}}{3 \\text{ packets per cheesecake}} = 5 \\text{ cheesecakes} \\)\n\nThe limiting factor here is the number of Oreos, as he can only make 5 cheesecakes with the 15 packets he has. Therefore, Lionel can make 5 cheesecakes.\n\nNext, we calculate how many boxes of Graham crackers are used in making 5 cheesecakes:\n- \\( 5 \\text{ cheesecakes} \\times 2 \\text{ boxes per cheesecake} = 10 \\text{ boxes} \\)\n\nLionel started with 14 boxes of Graham crackers and used 10 boxes to make the cheesecakes. Thus, the number of boxes left over is:\n- \\( 14 \\text{ boxes} - 10 \\text{ boxes} = 4 \\text{ boxes} \\)\n\nTherefore, Lionel will have 4 boxes of Graham crackers left over after making the cheesecakes.", "correctness": true}

Since Ian has half as much money as Jessica, and Jessica has $100, we calculate Ian's amount as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ian's money} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we know Rodney has $35 more than Ian. So, Rodney's amount is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rodney's money} = 50 + 35 = 85 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we compare Jessica's money to Rodney's money to find out how much more Jessica has than Rodney:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 100 - 85 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jessica has 15 dollars more than Rodney.", "correctness": true}
{"question": "TreShaun's full marker has enough ink in it to paint three 4 inch by 4 inch squares. If he colors in two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles, what percentage of ink is left?", "solution": "Each 4 by 4 square equals 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = <<4*4=16>>16\nThree squares equals 48 square inches because 3 x 16 = <<48=48>>48\nEach rectangle uses 12 square inches because 2 x 6 = <<2*6=12>>12\nBoth rectangles will use 24 square inches because 2 x 12 = <<2*12=24>>24\nHe has 1/2 of the ink left because 24 / 48 = 1/2\nHe has 50% of the ink left because 1/2 x 100 = <<1/2*100=50>>50\n#### 50", "answer": "50", "completion": "First, we calculate the area of the squares that TreShaun's marker can fully paint. Each square has a side length of 4 inches, so the area of one square is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ inches} \\times 4 \\text{ inches} = 16 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nSince the marker can paint three such squares, the total area it can cover is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 16 \\text{ square inches} = 48 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the rectangles TreShaun actually paints. Each rectangle has dimensions of 6 inches by 2 inches, so the area of one rectangle is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\text{ inches} \\times 2 \\text{ inches} = 12 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nSince he paints two rectangles, the total area painted is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 \\text{ square inches} = 24 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nNow, we determine how much ink is used and how much remains. The marker initially had enough ink to paint 48 square inches, and TreShaun used it to paint 24 square inches. The amount of ink used is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{24 \\text{ square inches}}{48 \\text{ square inches}} = 0.5 \\text{ or } 50\\% \\]\n\nThus, the percentage of ink remaining is:\n\n\\[ 100\\% - 50\\% = 50\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, 50% of the ink is left in TreShaun's marker.", "correctness": true}
{"question": "Mary bought a packet of 1500 stickers. She shared them between Susan, Andrew and Sam in the ratio 1:1:3 respectively.

This means that for every 5 parts, Susan gets 1 part, Andrew gets 1 part, and Sam gets 3 parts.\n\nThe total number of parts is \\(1 + 1 + 3 = 5\\).\n\nMary bought a total of 1500 stickers. To find out how many stickers each part corresponds to, we divide the total number of stickers by the total number of parts:\n\\[\n\\frac{1500}{5} = 300\n\\]\nThis means each part is worth 300 stickers.\n\n- Susan receives \\(1 \\times 300 = 300\\) stickers.\n- Andrew receives \\(1 \\times 300 = 300\\) stickers.\n- Sam receives \\(3 \\times 300 = 900\\) stickers.\n\nNext, according to the problem, Sam gives Andrew two-thirds of his own share.
