How many of those who attended did not bring gifts?", "solution": "16 x 3/4 = <<16*3/4=12>>12 boys brought gifts.\nSo, 16 -12 = <<16-12=4>>4 boys did not bring gifts.\n14 x 6/7 = <<14*6/7=12>>12 girls brought gifts.\nSo, 14 - 12 = <<14-12=2>>2 girls did not bring gifts.\nTherefore, a total of 4 boys + 2 girls = <<4+2=6>>6 people did not bring gifts.\n#### 6", "answer": "6", "completion": "To find the total number of attendees who did not bring gifts, we first need to calculate how many boys and girls brought gifts.\n\nNumber of boys who brought gifts = 3/4 * 16 = 12 boys\nNumber of girls who brought gifts = 6/7 * 14 = 12 girls\n\nTotal number of attendees who brought gifts = 12 boys + 12 girls = 24 attendees\n\nTotal number of attendees = 16 boys + 14 girls = 30 attendees\n\nNumber of attendees who did not bring gifts = Total number of attendees - Total number of attendees who brought gifts\n= 30 attendees - 24 attendees\n= 6 attendees\n\nTherefore, 6 attendees did not bring gifts to Simon's birthday party.", "correctness": true}
{"question": "Five months ago, Mike earned 10 times more money than Fred. If his salary has increased by 40 percent now, and Fred's salary then was $1000, calculate Mike's salary now.", "solution": "Five months ago, Mike earned ten times more money than Fred, and since Fred earned $1000, Mike earned 10*1000 = $<<10*1000=10000>>10000 more than Fred.\nThe total amount of money that Mike earned five months ago is $10000+$1000 = $<<10000+1000=11000>>11000\nMikes salary has increased by 40/100*$11000 = $<<40/100*11000=4400>>4400\nMike's current salary is $11000 +$4400 = $<<11000+4400=15400>>15400\n#### 15400", "answer": "15400", "completion": "Let's break down the information given step by step:\n\n1. Five months ago, Mike earned 10 times more money than Fred.\nLet's denote Fred's salary five months ago as F. So, Mike's salary five months ago would be 10F.\n\n2. If Fred's salary five months ago was $1000, then F = $1000.\n\n3. Mike's salary five months ago would be 10 * $1000 = $10,000.\n\n4. Mike's salary has increased by 40 percent now.\nIf Mike's salary five months ago was $10,000, a 40% increase would be 0.40 * $10,000 = $4,000.\n\n5. Therefore, Mike's salary now is $10,000 + $4,000 = $14,000.\n\nSo, Mike's salary now is $14,000.", "correctness": true}
