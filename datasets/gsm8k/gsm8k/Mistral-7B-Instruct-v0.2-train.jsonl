{"question": "Mike watches TV for 4 hours every day.  On the days he plays video games he plays for half as long as he watches TV.

Mike watches TV for 4 hours every day.\n2. On video game days, he spends half as much time playing video games as he does watching TV.\n3. Let's denote the number of video game hours as V and the number of TV hours as T.\n4. We know that T = 4 hours/day and V = 0.5 * T = 2 hours/day on video game days.\n5. Mike plays video games 3 days a week, so the total number of video game hours in a week is 2 hours/day * 3 days/week = 6 hours/week.\n6. Since Mike spends 16 hours in a week watching TV (4 hours/day * 4 days/week), the total number of hours he spends on both activities in a week is 16 hours (TV) + 6 hours (video games) = 22 hours/week.\n\nTherefore, Mike spends 16 hours/week watching TV and 6 hours/week playing video games.", "correctness": false, "paraphrased": "Mike watches television for 4 hours daily. On days when he plays video games, he does so for 2 hours, which is half the time he spends watching TV. Over a week, he plays video games for 3 days. Therefore, he spends 12 hours watching TV (4 hours per day for 3 days) and 6 hours playing video games (2 hours per day for 3 days) in those 3 days. On the remaining 4 days, he only watches TV, adding 16 hours (4 hours per day for 4 days) to his weekly total. Thus, Mike spends a total of 28 hours per week on these activities, with 16 hours on TV and 6 hours on video games."}

So, the winning team had 2x points.\n2. The winning team had 10 more points than it started with at the end of the second quarter. Since we know the winning team had 2x points at the end of the first quarter, we can find the number of points they had at the end of the second quarter by adding 10 to their first quarter points: 2x + 10.\n3. The winning team had 20 more points than they had at the end of the second quarter at the end of the third quarter.

Given that the winning team scored 80 points in total, we set up the equation '2x + 30 + 2x + 10 + x + 10 + x + 10 = 80'. Simplifying gives '6x + 60 = 80', leading to '6x = 20' and thus 'x = 3.33'.

We know that the tree is currently 5 feet tall and gains 3 feet per year.\n5. So, we can calculate the number of years it takes to grow an additional 18 feet (23 feet total - 5 feet current height) by dividing the total growth by the annual growth rate: 18 feet / 3 feet/year = 6 years.\n6.

Mike earned 10 times more than Fred, so Mike's salary five months ago was $10,000 ($1000 x 10).\n4. Mike's salary has increased by 40 percent since then.\n5. To find Mike's current salary, we need to calculate the new amount by adding 40 percent to his old salary.\n6. A 40 percent increase on $10,000 is $4,000.\n7. Adding $4,000 to Mike's old salary of $10,000 gives us his new salary of $14,000.\n\nSo, Mike's salary now is $14,000.", "correctness": false, "paraphrased": "To solve this, consider that initially, Mike's earnings were tenfold Fred's, who made $1000, putting Mike's earnings at $10,000. Over the past five months, Mike's earnings have risen by 40%. This increase translates to an additional $4,000, making his current earnings $14,000."}
