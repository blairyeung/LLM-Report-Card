How long does he spend making coffee over 24 days?", "solution": "He makes it in batches of 1.5*128=<<1.5*128=192>>192 ounces\nHe drinks 96/2=<<96/2=48>>48 ounces of coffee a day\nSo he drinks the coffee in 192/48=<<192/48=4>>4 days\nSo in 24 days he makes 24/4=<<24/4=6>>6 batches\nThat means he spends 6*20=<<6*20=120>>120 hours making coffee\n#### 120", "answer": "120", "completion": " First, let's determine how many batches of cold brew coffee Jack makes in 24 days. Since he consumes 96 ounces of coffee every 2 days, this means he drinks 48 ounces of coffee per day (96 ounces / 2 days).\n\nNow, let's find out how many days it takes for Jack to finish one batch of coffee. Since he drinks 48 ounces of coffee per day, one batch of 1.5 gallons (which is equal to 128 ounces) will last him:\n\n128 ounces / 48 ounces/day = 2.67 days\n\nSince we're only concerned with whole days, we'll round this up to 3 days.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many batches of coffee Jack makes in 24 days:\n\n24 days / 3 days/batch = 8 batches\n\nFinally, let's determine how long Jack spends making coffee over 24 days. Since it takes 20 hours to make one batch, the total time spent making coffee is:\n\n8 batches * 20 hours/batch = 160 hours\n\nSo, Jack spends 160 hours making coffee over 24 days.", "correctness": false, "paraphrased": "To determine the total time Jack spends making coffee over 24 days, we start by calculating his daily consumption, which is 48 ounces (96 ounces every 2 days). A batch of 1.5 gallons, equivalent to 128 ounces, lasts him approximately 2.67 days, rounded up to 3 days for simplicity. Over 24 days, Jack prepares 8 batches of coffee (24 days divided by 3 days per batch). Since each batch takes 20 hours to make, Jack spends a total of 160 hours making coffee during this period."}
{"question": "Lionel went to the grocery store and bought 14 boxes of Graham crackers and 15 packets of Oreos.

He can make as many cheesecakes as possible with the ingredient that is in the least supply.\n\nLionel has 14 boxes of Graham crackers and 15 packets of Oreos. To make one Oreo cheesecake, he needs 2 boxes of Graham crackers and 3 packets of Oreos. We'll calculate which ingredient will run out first:\n\nGraham crackers needed for 15 cheesecakes: 15 * 2 = 30 boxes\nOreos needed for 14 cheesecakes: 14 * 3 = 42 packets\n\nSince Lionel only has 14 boxes of Graham crackers, he can only make 14 cheesecakes. He will run out of Graham crackers before using up all his Oreos.\n\nNow, let's find out how many boxes of Graham crackers he would have left over:\n\nGraham crackers left over = Initial number of Graham crackers - Graham crackers needed for cheesecakes\n                                         = 14 - 2 * 14\n                                         = 14 - 28\n                                         = -14\n\nHowever, since the number of boxes left over cannot be negative, we adjust it to zero:\n\nSo, Lionel would have 0 boxes of Graham crackers left over after making the maximum number of Oreo cheesecakes he can with the ingredients he bought.", "correctness": false, "paraphrased": "To figure out how many Oreo cheesecakes Lionel can prepare, we need to consider the ingredients he has. Lionel bought 14 boxes of Graham crackers and 15 packets of Oreos. Each cheesecake requires 2 boxes of Graham crackers and 3 packets of Oreos. Calculating the maximum number of cheesecakes based on the available Graham crackers (14 boxes), he can make 14 cheesecakes. After using 28 boxes of Graham crackers for these cheesecakes, he would have none left, as 14 minus 28 equals zero."}
{"question": "Rodney has 35 dollars more than Ian. Ian has half as much money as Jessica has.
