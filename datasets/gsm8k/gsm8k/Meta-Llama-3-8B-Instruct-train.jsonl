So, the total time for cleaning the house is:\n\n7 tasks x 10 minutes/task = 70 minutes\n\n**Taking a shower:** Trey has 1 task to do, and each task takes 10 minutes. So, the total time for taking a shower is:\n\n1 task x 10 minutes/task = 10 minutes\n\n**Making dinner:** Trey has 4 tasks to do, and each task takes 10 minutes. So, the total time for making dinner is:\n\n4 tasks x 10 minutes/task = 40 minutes\n\nNow, let's add up the total time for all tasks:\n\n70 minutes (cleaning) + 10 minutes (shower) + 40 minutes (dinner) = 120 minutes\n\nTo convert this to hours, we can divide the total minutes by 60:\n\n120 minutes ÷ 60 = 2 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take Trey 2 hours to complete his list of tasks.", "correctness": true, "paraphrased": "Trey's Sunday involves several chores divided into three main categories: house cleaning, showering, and dinner preparation. He needs to complete 7 cleaning tasks, each taking 10 minutes, totaling 70 minutes.

With 128 ounces in a gallon, Jack's 96 ounces every two days equals 0.75 gallons. This breaks down to 0.375 gallons per day. Given that Jack prepares his coffee in 1.5 gallon batches, he needs 0.25 of a batch daily. Each batch takes 20 hours to make, so Jack spends 5 hours each day on coffee preparation. Over 24 days, this amounts to a total of 120 hours spent on making coffee."}

Since the area of a square is side length squared, the area of each 4-inch by 4-inch square is:\n\n4 inches x 4 inches = 16 square inches\n\nSince the marker can paint three of these squares, the total area it can paint is:\n\n16 square inches/square x 3 squares = 48 square inches\n\nNow, let's find the total area of the two 6-inch by 2-inch rectangles that TreShaun colors in. The area of each rectangle is:\n\n6 inches x 2 inches = 12 square inches\n\nSince there are two rectangles, the total area colored in is:\n\n12 square inches/rectangle x 2 rectangles = 24 square inches\n\nNow, let's subtract the area colored in from the total area the marker can paint:\n\n48 square inches (total area) - 24 square inches (colored area) = 24 square inches\n\nThis means that 24 square inches of ink are left unused.
