To find out how many years it takes for the tree to reach 23 feet tall, we can set up an equation:\n\nInitial height + (Number of years x Growth rate) = Final height\n5 + (Number of years x 3) = 23\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides to get:\n(Number of years x 3) = 18\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to get:\nNumber of years = 18/3\nNumber of years = 6\n\nSo, it takes 6 years for the tree to grow from 5 feet to 23 feet. Since the tree was 1 year old when it was planted, we add 6 years to its initial age:\n\nAge of tree when it's 23 feet tall = 1 + 6\nAge of tree when it's 23 feet tall = 7\n\nTherefore, the tree is 7 years old when it reaches 23 feet tall.", "correctness": true, "paraphrased": "To determine the age of a tree when it reaches 23 feet, starting from an initial height of 5 feet and growing at a rate of 3 feet per year, we can use the following calculation: First, calculate the total growth needed to reach 23 feet by subtracting the initial height from the target height, resulting in 18 feet.

If each box of cereal contains 500 clusters of oats, how many bowlfuls of cereal are in each box?", "solution": "If each spoonful contains 4 clusters of oats, and each bowl of cereal has 25 spoonfuls, then in each bowl there are 4*25=<<4*25=100>>100 clusters of oats.\nAnd If each box of cereal contains 500 clusters of oats, then there are 500/100=<<500/100=5>>5 bowlfuls of cereal in every box.\n#### 5", "answer": "5", "completion": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. In each spoonful, there are 4 clusters of oats.\n2. In each bowl of cereal, Mikey gets 25 spoonfuls of cereal.\n3. So, in each bowl of cereal, there are 25 x 4 = 100 clusters of oats.\n4. Each box of cereal contains 500 clusters of oats.\n5. To find out how many bowlfuls of cereal are in each box, we can divide the total number of clusters in the box (500) by the number of clusters in each bowl (100).\n\n500 ÷ 100 = 5\n\nTherefore, there are 5 bowlfuls of cereal in each box.", "correctness": true, "paraphrased": "To determine how many bowls of cereal are in each box, consider the following: Each spoonful contains 4 clusters of oats, and each bowl consists of 25 spoonfuls. This means there are 100 clusters in each bowl. Given that a box holds 500 clusters, dividing the total clusters by the clusters per bowl gives us 5 bowls per box."}

She also used 1 container to paint flowers on the ceiling. So she used 12 + 1 = 13 containers of paint. She started with 16, so she has 16 - 13 = 3 containers of paint left over. The answer is 3.", "correctness": -1, "paraphrased": "Mikaela initially purchased 16 containers of paint for her bathroom. However, she opted to tile one of the walls and use one container for ceiling decorations. Consequently, she only needed to paint three of the four walls.

She counted 42 fewer hyenas than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined, so the number of hyenas is 194 - 42 = 152.\n5. She counted 50 more wild dogs than hyenas, so the number of wild dogs is 152 + 50 = 202.\n6. The number of leopards is half the number of rabbits, so the number of leopards is 114 / 2 = 57.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of animals:\n\n80 (antelopes) + 114 (rabbits) + 152 (hyenas) + 202 (wild dogs) + 57 (leopards) = 605\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals that Josie counted is 605.", "correctness": true, "paraphrased": "To solve this, we start by noting that Josie saw 80 antelopes. Since there were 34 more rabbits than antelopes, this makes 114 rabbits. Adding the antelopes and rabbits gives 194 animals. From this total, if we subtract 42, we get 152 hyenas.

Converting ounces to gallons, where 1 gallon equals 128 ounces, he drinks 4.5 gallons in 24 days (576 ounces / 128 ounces per gallon). Jack prepares his coffee in 1.5 gallon batches, necessitating three batches to meet his 24-day needs (4.5 gallons / 1.5 gallons per batch). Since each batch takes 20 hours to prepare, Jack spends a total of 60 hours making coffee over the 24 days (3 batches x 20 hours per batch)."}
