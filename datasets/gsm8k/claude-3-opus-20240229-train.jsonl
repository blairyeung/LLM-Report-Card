Convert gallons to ounces:\n   * 1 gallon = 128 ounces\n   * 1.5 gallons = 1.5 × 128 = 192 ounces\n\n2. Find out how many days one batch of coffee lasts:\n   * Jack drinks 96 ounces every 2 days\n   * One batch is 192 ounces\n   * Number of days one batch lasts = 192 ÷ 96 × 2 = 4 days\n\n3. Find the number of batches needed for 24 days:\n   * Number of batches = 24 days ÷ 4 days per batch = 6 batches\n\n4. Calculate the total time spent making coffee over 24 days:\n   * Time spent making one batch = 20 hours\n   * Total time spent = 6 batches × 20 hours per batch = 120 hours\n\nTherefore, Jack spends 120 hours making coffee over 24 days.", "correctness": true}

Find the limiting ingredient:\n   - With 14 boxes of Graham crackers, Lionel can make at most 14 ÷ 2 = 7 cheesecakes.\n   - With 15 packets of Oreos, Lionel can make at most 15 ÷ 3 = 5 cheesecakes.\n   - Therefore, Oreos are the limiting ingredient, and Lionel can make a maximum of 5 cheesecakes.\n\n2. Calculate the number of Graham cracker boxes used:\n   - For 5 cheesecakes, Lionel will use 5 × 2 = 10 boxes of Graham crackers.\n\n3. Calculate the number of Graham cracker boxes left:\n   - Lionel bought 14 boxes of Graham crackers and used 10 boxes.\n   - So, he will have 14 - 10 = 4 boxes of Graham crackers left.\n\nTherefore, after making the maximum number of Oreo cheesecakes, Lionel will have 4 boxes of Graham crackers left over.", "correctness": true}

Understand the given information:\n   * TreShaun's marker has enough ink to paint three 4 inch by 4 inch squares.\n   * He colors in two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles.\n\n2. Calculate the total area that the marker can paint:\n   * Area of one 4 inch by 4 inch square = 4 inches × 4 inches = 16 square inches\n   * Total area the marker can paint = 3 × 16 square inches = 48 square inches\n\n3. Calculate the area TreShaun colored:\n   * Area of one 6 inch by 2 inch rectangle = 6 inches × 2 inches = 12 square inches\n   * Total area TreShaun colored = 2 × 12 square inches = 24 square inches\n\n4. Calculate the remaining area that can be painted:\n   * Remaining area = Total area the marker can paint - Total area TreShaun colored\n   * Remaining area = 48 square inches - 24 square inches = 24 square inches\n\n5. Calculate the percentage of ink left:\n   * Percentage of ink left = (Remaining area ÷ Total area the marker can paint) × 100\n   * Percentage of ink left = (24 square inches ÷ 48 square inches) × 100\n   * Percentage of ink left = 0.5 × 100 = 50%\n\nTherefore, after TreShaun colors in two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles, 50% of the ink is left in his marker.", "correctness": true}
