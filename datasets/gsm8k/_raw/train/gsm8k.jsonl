If the blue one can travel at a speed of 80 miles per hour, at what speed, in miles per hour, can the red car travel?", "solution": "If the blue car can travel at 80 mph, then the green one can travel at 8*80=<<8*80=640>>640 mph\nIf the green car can travel at 640 mph, then the red can travel at 2*640=1280 mph\n#### 1280", "answer": "1280"}
{"question": "Sixteen boys and 14 girls attended Simon's birthday party. Three-fourths of the boys and 6/7 of the girls brought gifts. How many of those who attended did not bring gifts?", "solution": "16 x 3/4 = <<16*3/4=12>>12 boys brought gifts.\nSo, 16 -12 = <<16-12=4>>4 boys did not bring gifts.\n14 x 6/7 = <<14*6/7=12>>12 girls brought gifts.\nSo, 14 - 12 = <<14-12=2>>2 girls did not bring gifts.\nTherefore, a total of 4 boys + 2 girls = <<4+2=6>>6 people did not bring gifts.\n#### 6", "answer": "6"}
