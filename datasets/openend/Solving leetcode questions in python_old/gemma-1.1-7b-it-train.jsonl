{"question": "How would you implement a function to use context managers for resource management in Python?", "completion": "**Step 1: Define a Context Manager Class**\n\n```python\nclass ResourceManager(contextlib.ContextDecorator):\n    def __init__(self, acquire_func, release_func):\n        self.acquire_func = acquire_func\n        self.release_func = release_func\n\n    def __enter__(self):\n        return self.acquire_func()\n\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, traceback):\n        if exc_type is None:\n            self.release_func()\n```\n\n**Step 2: Create Resource Acquisition and Release Functions**\n\n```python\ndef acquire_resource():\n    # Code to acquire the resource\n    pass\n\ndef release_resource(resource):\n    # Code to release the resource\n    pass\n```\n\n**Step 3: Use the Context Manager**\n\n```python\nwith ResourceManager(acquire_resource, release_resource):\n    # Code to use the resource\n    pass\n```\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\nclass DatabaseConnectionManager(ResourceManager):\n    def acquire_connection(self):\n        # Connect to the database\n        pass\n\n    def release_connection(self, connection):\n        # Close the database connection\n        pass\n\nwith DatabaseConnectionManager() as connection:\n    # Perform database operations\n    pass\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* The `ResourceManager` class defines two methods: `__enter__` and `__exit__`.\n* `__enter__` is called when the `with` statement is entered. It calls the `acquire_resource()` function to obtain the resource.\n* `__exit__` is called when the `with` statement is exited. It calls the `release_resource()` function to release the resource, only if no exception was raised.\n* The code within the `with` statement can access the resource using the `connection` variable.\n\n**Benefits of using context managers:**\n\n* **Resource management:** Ensures that resources are properly released when an exception is raised or the `with` statement is exited.\n* **Improved readability:** Makes code more readable and maintainable by encapsulating resource acquisition and release.\n* **Exception handling:** Handles exceptions gracefully and ensures resource release in case of errors.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* Context managers are designed to handle resource management in Python.\n* The `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods are the core methods of a context manager.\n* The `with` statement is used to interact with a context manager."}

If so, it returns `True`.\n    * If the current position is outside the maze or if the cell is blocked, it returns `False`.\n\n\n* **Backtracking Algorithm:**\n    * It iterates over the four possible directions (up, right, down, left).\n    * For each direction, it calculates the new row and column positions.\n    * It checks if the new position is within the maze, is not blocked, and has not been visited before.\n    * If all these conditions are met, it recursively calls itself with the new position as the starting point.\n    * If the recursive call returns `True`, it means that a path was found, and the function returns `True`.\n\n\n* **Result:**\n    * The function returns `True` if a path was found from the start to the end of the maze, and `False` otherwise.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\nmaze = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0],\n]\n\nstart = (0, 0)\nend = (2, 3)\n\nresult = rat_in_maze(maze, start, end)\n\nprint(result)  # Output: True\n```\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(2^n), where n is the size of the maze.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(n), due to the recursive call stack."}

{"question": "How would you implement a function to check if two strings are one edit distance apart?", "completion": "**Algorithm for Checking if Two Strings are One Edit Distance Apart:**\n\n**1. Initialization:**\n- Create a 2D table where rows and columns represent the two strings.\n- Initialize the table with 0s along the diagonal and 1s everywhere else.\n\n\n**2. Filling the Table:**\n- For the first row and column, set the value to 0 if the characters match, and 1 if they differ.\n- For other cells, consider the three possibilities:\n    - **Insertion:** If the character in the first string is different from the character in the second string, and the character in the second string is not in the first string, then the edit distance is 1.\n    - **Deletion:** If the character in the first string is different from the character in the second string, and the character in the first string is not in the second string, then the edit distance is 1.\n    - **Substitution:** If the characters in both strings are different, then the edit distance is 1.\n\n\n**3.

{"question": "Write a Python function to use generator expressions for memory-efficient code.", "completion": "```python\ndef process_data(data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Processes data in a memory-efficient manner using generator expressions.\n\n    Args:\n        data: An iterable of data.\n\n    Returns:\n        A generator object that yields processed data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Generator expression to process each item in the data.\n    processed_data = (\n        item ** 2\n        for item in data\n        if item % 2 == 0\n    )\n\n    # Yield the processed data.\n    for item in processed_data:\n        yield item\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* The function defines a generator expression `processed_data` using the generator syntax `( ... for ... )`.\n* The expression iterates over the input `data` and squares each item.\n* The `if` condition filters out odd numbers.\n* The `yield` keyword suspends the generator function and allows it to be resumed later when the function is called.\n\n**Memory efficiency:**\n\n* Generator expressions are memory-efficient because they only generate the data when it is requested, rather than storing it all in memory at once.\n* This is especially important for large datasets where memory consumption can be a concern.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```python\n# Example usage:\ndata = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n# Process the data and print the results.\nfor item in process_data(data):\n    print(item)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n4\n16\n36\n64\n100\n```\n\n**Benefits of using generator expressions for memory efficiency:**\n\n* Reduced memory consumption by only generating data when needed.\n* Improved performance for large datasets.\n* More flexible and reusable code.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* Generator expressions are not suitable for all scenarios. In cases where the processed data needs to be stored in memory, other data structures may be more appropriate.\n* The `yield` keyword must be used to suspend the generator function."}
{"question": "Implement a Python function to handle timeouts for a long-running task.", "completion": "```python\nimport time\nimport functools\n\ndef timeout(seconds):\n    def decorator(func):\n        @functools.wraps(func)\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            start = time.time()\n            try:\n                result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n                if time.time() - start > seconds:\n                    raise TimeoutError(\"Task took longer than the specified timeout.\")\n                return result\n            except Exception as e:\n                raise TimeoutError(f\"Timeout occurred while executing function. {e}\") from e\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```python\n@timeout(seconds=60)\ndef long_running_task():\n    # Simulate a long-running task\n    time.sleep(90)\n    return \"Task completed successfully.\"\n\n# Call the function with a timeout of 60 seconds\nresult = long_running_task()\nprint(result)  # Output: \"Task completed successfully.\"\n\n# If the timeout is exceeded, a TimeoutError will be raised\ntry:\n    long_running_task()\nexcept TimeoutError as e:\n    print(e)  # Output: \"Timeout occurred while executing function. Task took longer than the specified timeout.\"\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `timeout` function takes a single argument, `seconds`, which specifies the timeout duration in seconds.\n* The decorator wraps the target function `func`.\n* When the function is called, it tracks the start time and checks if the execution time exceeds the timeout.\n* If the timeout is exceeded, a `TimeoutError` is raised.\n* The decorator also handles any exceptions raised by the target function and re-raises them with the timeout error message.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* The decorator is transparent to the function being decorated.\n* It raises a specific `TimeoutError` with a clear message.\n* It handles both normal exceptions and timeouts gracefully.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* Ensures that long-running tasks do not block indefinitely.\n* Provides a way to gracefully handle timeouts and recover from them.\n* Improves application performance by preventing hangs and resource consumption."}
