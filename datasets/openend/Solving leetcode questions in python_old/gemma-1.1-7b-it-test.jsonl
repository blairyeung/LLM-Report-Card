{"question": "How would you implement a hash table in Python?", "completion": "**Step 1: Define the Hash Table Class**\n\n```python\nclass HashTable:\n    def __init__(self, size=10):\n        self.table = [None] * size\n```\n\n* The class HashTable has a table attribute that is a list of None values of the specified size.\n* The size of the hash table can be adjusted as needed.\n\n\n**Step 2: Define Hash Function**\n\n```python\ndef hash(key):\n    return key % self.table_size\n```\n\n* This function calculates the index of the bucket for a given key using the modulo operator.\n* The table_size is an attribute of the HashTable class.\n\n**Step 3: Insert Function**\n\n```python\ndef insert(self, key, value):\n    index = hash(key)\n    if self.table[index] is None:\n        self.table[index] = [(key, value)]\n    else:\n        self.table[index].append((key, value))\n```\n\n* This function inserts a key-value pair into the hash table.\n* It calculates the index of the bucket using the hash function and then inserts the pair into the list at that index.\n\n**Step 4: Search Function**\n\n```python\ndef search(self, key):\n    index = hash(key)\n    if self.table[index] is None:\n        return None\n    for item in self.table[index]:\n        if item[0] == key:\n            return item[1]\n    return None\n```\n\n* This function searches for a key in the hash table.\n* It calculates the index of the bucket using the hash function and then iterates over the list at that index to find the key.\n\n**Step 5: Example Usage**\n\n```python\n# Create a hash table\nht = HashTable()\n\n# Insert some key-value pairs\nht.insert('name', 'John Doe')\nht.insert('email', 'john.doe@example.com')\n\n# Search for a key\nname = ht.search('name')  # 'John Doe'\nemail = ht.search('email')  # 'john.doe@example.com'\n```\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Hashing:** Keys are mapped to indices using a hash function.\n* **Collision Handling:** When multiple keys hash to the same index, collisions are handled by storing key-value pairs in a list at that index.\n* **Efficiency:** Hash tables offer efficient search and insertion operations with an average time complexity of O(1)."}

Otherwise, it adds the node from `list2` to the next of `curr`.\n* After the loop, it adds the remaining nodes of the non-exhausted list to the next of `curr`.\n* Finally, it returns the `next` node of `dummy`, which is the head of the merged list.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\n# Example linked lists\nlist1 = ListNode(1)\nlist1.next = ListNode(2)\nlist1.next.next = ListNode(4)\n\nlist2 = ListNode(1)\nlist2.next = ListNode(3)\nlist2.next.next = ListNode(4)\n\n# Merge the two lists\nmergedList = mergeTwoLists(list1, list2)\n\n# Print the merged list\nwhile mergedList:\n    print(mergedList.val)\n    mergedList = mergedList.next\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n1 1 2 3 4 4\n```\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the input lists.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(1), as the function only requires a few pointers to point to the nodes in the lists."}

{"question": "How would you implement memoization in a recursive function in Python?", "completion": "**Memoization in a Recursive Function in Python:**\n\nMemoization is a technique to cache the results of function calls with the same input to avoid redundant calculations. \n\n**Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    cache = {}\n    \n    def _fibonacci(n):\n        if n in cache:\n            return cache[n]\n        \n        if n < 2:\n            return n\n        \n        result = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n        cache[n] = result\n        return result\n    \n    return _fibonacci(n)\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Cache creation:**\n   - A dictionary called `cache` is initialized outside the recursive function `_fibonacci()`.\n2. **Cache check:**\n   - Before performing recursion, it checks if the current input `n` is already in the `cache`.\n3. **Recursive call:**\n   - If `n` is not in the cache, the function proceeds with the recursive call to `fibonacci(n-1)` and `fibonacci(n-2)`.\n4. **Cache update:**\n   - The results of the recursive calls are stored in the `cache` dictionary with the key `n`.\n5. **Result retrieval:**\n   - If the input `n` is encountered again, the result is retrieved from the `cache` instead of performing the recursive call.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\n>>> fibonacci(5)\n5\n>>> fibonacci(5)\n5\n```\n\n**Benefits of Memoization:**\n\n- **Improved performance:** Reduces redundant recursive calls for the same input.\n- **Reduced memory usage:** Caches the results of previous calls, preventing the need to recalculate them.\n- **Efficiency:** More efficient for large inputs where recursion can become expensive.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n- The cache should be defined outside the recursive function to avoid creating a new cache for each function call.\n- The cache key should be based on the input parameters to ensure that cached results are reused for the same input values.\n- The cache should be cleared when necessary to avoid stale data."}
