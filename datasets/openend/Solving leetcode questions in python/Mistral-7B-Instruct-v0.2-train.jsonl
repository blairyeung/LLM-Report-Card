If the cell (i, j) is the first cell in the matrix, then the length of the longest increasing path to reach that cell is 1.\n4. After calculating the length of the longest increasing path to reach all cells, the answer will be the maximum of all these lengths.\nHere's the Python code for the above approach:\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_path(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return 0\n    n = len(matrix)\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    dp = [[-1] * m for _ in range(n)]\n    max_len = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if dp[i][j] == -1:\n                up = dp[i-1][j] if i > 0 else 0\n                left = dp[i][j-1] if j > 0 else 0\n                dp[i][j] = max(up, left) + 1\n                max_len = max(max_len, dp[i][j])\n    return max_len\n```\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is much better than the brute-force approach, which has a time complexity of O(2^n)."}

Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular and efficient shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs.\n\nHere's how Dijkstra's algorithm works:\n\n1. Initialize the distance from the source node to all other nodes as infinite, except for the source node, which is set to 0.\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance from the source node and mark it as visited.\n3. Update the distances of all neighboring nodes of the current node. If the distance to a neighbor is calculated to be shorter than the current stored distance, update the distance and mark the neighbor as unvisited.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes have been visited.\n\nThe time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is O(E + V log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. This is an improvement over BFS for large graphs, as the time complexity of BFS is O(V + E).\n\nTo implement Dijkstra's algorithm in code, you can use a priority queue to keep track of the nodes with the smallest distances. Here's a Python implementation:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start):\n    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    queue = [(0, start)]\n\n    while queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)\n\n        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:\n            continue\n\n        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():\n            distance = current_distance + weight\n\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))\n\n    return distances\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a dictionary to store the distances from the source node to all other nodes, and a list of tuples to represent the priority queue. The `heapq.heappush` and `heapq.heappop` functions are used to maintain the priority queue property.\n\nYou can use this implementation to find the shortest path in an undirected graph with weighted edges by passing the graph and the start node as arguments:\n\n```python\ngraph = {\n    'A': {'B': 3, 'C': 4},\n    'B': {'A': 3, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},\n    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},\n    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}\n}\n\nshortest_path = dijkstra(graph, 'A')\nprint(shortest_path)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n{'A': 0, 'B': 3, 'C': 4, 'D': 5}\n```\n\nThis means that the shortest path from node 'A' to all other nodes in the graph is:\n\n- A to B: 3 units\n- A to C: 4 units\n- A to D: 5 units."}

The indices of these lists are calculated using negative indices for `right_min` to make the indexing consistent with the given list `heights`.\nAlso note that the above code assumes that the given list `heights` is not empty. If the list can be empty, the function should include a check for this case and return 0 in that case."}

One such algorithm is the QuickSelect algorithm, which is an efficient in-place variation of the Quicksort algorithm.\nQuickSelect is a recursive algorithm that uses the partitioning step of Quicksort to find the k-th smallest element. The partitioning step divides the array into two parts: one with elements smaller than a pivot element, and another with elements greater than or equal to the pivot. By carefully choosing the pivot, we can ensure that the k-th smallest element is in the smaller partition, and we can recursively apply the algorithm to that partition.\nThe choice of pivot is crucial for the efficiency of QuickSelect. A good pivot is one that splits the array into roughly equal halves. One common method for choosing a pivot is to select the median of three elements: the first, middle, and last elements of the array.\nHere's a high-level description of the QuickSelect algorithm:\n1. Choose a pivot element.\n2. Partition the array into two parts: one with elements smaller than the pivot, and another with elements greater than or equal to the pivot.\n3. If the pivot is the k-th smallest element, return it.\n4. If k is smaller than the size of the smaller partition, recursively apply the algorithm to the smaller partition.\n5. If k is larger than the size of the smaller partition, recursively apply the algorithm to the larger partition.\nThe time complexity of QuickSelect is O(n), on average, where n is the size of the array. This is much faster than the O(n log n) time complexity of sorting algorithms for large datasets.\nHere's some sample code in Python to implement QuickSelect:\n```python\ndef quickselect(arr, k):\n    def partition(arr, low, high):\n        pivot = arr[high]\n        i = low - 1\n        for j in range(low, high):\n            if arr[j] < pivot:\n                i += 1\n                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n        arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]\n        return i + 1\n    low = 0\n    high = len(arr) - 1\n    while low <= high:\n        pivot = partition(arr, low, high)\n        if pivot == k - 1:\n            return arr[k - 1]\n        elif pivot < k - 1:\n            low = pivot + 1\n        else:\n            high = pivot - 1\n```\nThis implementation uses recursion to find the k-th smallest element in the array. The `partition` function is used to partition the array around a pivot element, and the `quickselect` function is used to recursively apply the partitioning step until the k-th smallest element is found."}

The `minVal` and `maxVal` variables are initialized with `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` respectively. This is a common approach to represent the minimum and maximum values for a binary search tree. However, it's important to note that floating-point numbers may not be the best choice for this problem since the tree's values are integers. Instead, you could initialize them with large and small integers, respectively.\n2. The code does not handle the case where the binary tree is empty (i.e., `root` is `None`). In this case, the function should return `True` since an empty tree is a valid BST.\n3. The code assumes that the `TreeNode` class is defined correctly and that the `val` attribute represents the node's value.\n\nOverall, the code looks correct, but it's always a good idea to test it with various input cases to ensure its correctness."}

The `for` loop iterates through the rest of the elements in the array, updating the `current_max` variable with the maximum of the current number and the sum of the current number and the previous number.

Initialize an empty Hash Set, say \"window\", to keep track of the distinct elements in the current subarray.\n3.

This approach ensures that the function runs efficiently as it only visits each node once during the traversal."}

Then, it initializes an empty list `merged` and appends the first interval to it. For each subsequent interval, it checks if the end time of the last merged interval is greater than or equal to the start time of the current interval. If it is, it merges the two intervals by updating the end time of the last merged interval. If not, it appends the current interval to the `merged` list.

This effectively moves the correct number to its position. After the iteration, we check the last element in the array to ensure that all numbers up to the last index have been accounted for.
