We start by sorting the input array `nums`. This is done to ensure that we can efficiently find unique triplets and avoid duplicates.\n2.  We initialize an empty list `triplets` to store the unique triplets that sum up to the target.\n3.  We iterate through the sorted array using a for loop, considering each element as the first element of a potential triplet.\n4.  We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find the remaining two elements that sum up to the target. We initialize `left` to the next element after the current element and `right` to the last element in the array.\n5.  We calculate the total sum of the current triplet using the formula `nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]`. If the total sum is less than the target, we increment `left` to increase the sum. If the total sum is greater than the target, we decrement `right` to decrease the sum.\n6.  If the total sum equals the target, we add the triplet to the `triplets` list. To avoid duplicates, we skip any duplicate elements in the `left` and `right` pointers by checking if `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` are equal to the previous elements.\n7.  We repeat steps 4-6 until `left` is no longer less than `right`.\n8.  Finally, we return the `triplets` list containing all unique triplets that sum up to the target.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array, and a space complexity of O(n) for storing the unique triplets. The sorting step dominates the time complexity, and the use of two pointers and the skip duplicates logic ensures that we avoid duplicates and optimize performance."}

If there are no more digits to process (`next_digits` is empty), the function adds the current combination to the output list.\n6.  Otherwise, the function iterates over each letter that the next digit can represent. For each letter, it recursively calls `backtrack` with the updated combination and the remaining digits.\n7.  Finally, the function calls `backtrack` with an empty combination and the input digits, and returns the output list of all possible combinations.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it uses a recursive approach to generate combinations, which allows it to handle large inputs without using excessive memory. The time complexity is O(3^n), where n is the length of the input string, because each digit can represent up to 3 letters. The space complexity is O(n), because the function needs to store the current combination and the remaining digits."}

In each iteration, calculate the middle value (mid) and count the number of elements in the matrix that are less than or equal to mid.\n4.

We start by counting the frequency of each element in the list using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module. This step has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list.\n2.  We create a heap to store the top k frequent elements. We use a min-heap, but since we want the top k frequent elements, we store the negative frequency of each element to simulate a max-heap.\n3.  We iterate through the frequency dictionary and push each element and its frequency onto the heap. If the heap size exceeds k, we pop the smallest element (which is the least frequent one) to maintain the heap size at k.\n4.  Finally, we extract the top k frequent elements from the heap by popping the elements k times. We use a list comprehension to extract the elements from the heap.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log k), which is better than the original sorting-based approach for large lists. The space complexity is O(n), which is the same as the original approach.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the list contains only hashable elements. If the list contains unhashable elements, you may need to use a different approach."}

We create a list `dp` to store the minimum number of coins needed to make up each amount from 0 to the given amount.

For each amount, we update the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount by considering the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount minus the current coin value and adding 1 (for the current coin). We use the `min` function to ensure we take the minimum number of coins.\n4.  Finally, we return the minimum number of coins needed to make up the given amount.

We initialize an empty list `merged_intervals` to store the merged intervals, and set `current_interval` to the first interval in the input list.\n3. We iterate through the remaining intervals, starting from the second one. For each interval, we check if it overlaps with the previous one by checking if the end time of the previous interval is greater than or equal to the start time of the current interval. If it does, we merge the two intervals by updating the end time of the current interval to be the maximum of the two end times.\n4. If the current interval does not overlap with the previous one, we add the previous interval to the `merged_intervals` list and start a new interval with the current one.\n5. Finally, we add the last interval to the `merged_intervals` list and return the result.\n\nThis function has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of intervals.

Here's a Python implementation of the BFS algorithm:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the shortest path between two users in an undirected graph.\n\n    Args:\n    graph (dict): A dictionary representing the graph, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes.\n    start (str): The starting node.\n    end (str): The ending node.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of nodes representing the shortest path from the start node to the end node.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Create a queue for BFS and enqueue the starting node\n    queue = deque([[start]])\n    \n    # Create a set to keep track of visited nodes\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue the first path from the queue\n        path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Get the last node from the path\n        node = path[-1]\n        \n        # If the node is not visited, mark it as visited\n        if node not in visited:\n            visited.add(node)\n            \n            # If the node is the end node, return the path\n            if node == end:\n                return path\n            \n            # Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes\n            for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):\n                if neighbor not in visited:\n                    queue.append(list(path) + [neighbor])\n    \n    # If there's no path from the start node to the end node, return an empty list\n    return []\n```\n\nTo optimize this function, we can use the following techniques:\n\n1.  **Early termination**: If the end node is found, we can immediately return the path and stop the algorithm. This can significantly reduce the number of nodes to be visited.\n2.  **Pruning**: We can prune the search by avoiding nodes that are not reachable from the start node. This can be done by keeping track of the nodes that are reachable from the start node and only enqueueing nodes that are not yet visited.\n3.  **Heuristics**: We can use heuristics to guide the search towards the end node. For example, we can use the Manhattan distance or the Euclidean distance to estimate the distance from the current node to the end node and prioritize nodes with a lower estimated distance.\n\nHere's an optimized version of the function that incorporates early termination and pruning:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the shortest path between two users in an undirected graph.\n\n    Args:\n    graph (dict): A dictionary representing the graph, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes.\n    start (str): The starting node.\n    end (str): The ending node.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of nodes representing the shortest path from the start node to the end node.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Create a queue for BFS and enqueue the starting node\n    queue = deque([[start]])\n    \n    # Create a set to keep track of visited nodes\n    visited = set()\n    \n    # Create a set to keep track of reachable nodes\n    reachable = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue the first path from the queue\n        path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Get the last node from the path\n        node = path[-1]\n        \n        # If the node is not visited, mark it as visited\n        if node not in visited:\n            visited.add(node)\n            \n            # If the node is the end node, return the path\n            if node == end:\n                return path\n            \n            # Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes\n            for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):\n                if neighbor not in visited:\n                    queue.append(list(path) + [neighbor])\n                    reachable.add(neighbor)\n    \n    # If there's no path from the start node to the end node, return an empty list\n    return []\n```\n\nThis optimized function uses early termination and pruning to reduce the number of nodes to be visited, making it more efficient."}

This can be done by creating a 2D array to store the longest increasing path length for each cell. Before calculating the longest increasing path for a cell, check if the result is already stored in the memoization array. If it is, return the stored value instead of recalculating it.\n\n2. **Pruning**: Implement pruning to reduce the number of cells to be processed. This can be done by checking if the current cell's value is less than the previous cell's value. If it is, there's no need to continue the DFS from this cell, as the path cannot be increasing. This can significantly reduce the number of cells to be processed, especially for large matrices.\n\n3. **Early termination**: Implement early termination to stop the DFS as soon as a cell is found that is not part of the longest increasing path. This can be done by checking if the current cell's value is not greater than the previous cell's value. If it's not, it means the path has ended, and there's no need to continue the DFS.\n\n4. **Parallel processing**: Implement parallel processing to take advantage of multi-core processors. This can be done by dividing the matrix into smaller sub-matrices and processing them concurrently using multiple threads or processes.\n\n5. **Optimized DFS**: Implement an optimized DFS algorithm that minimizes the number of recursive calls. This can be done by using an iterative approach instead of recursive calls, or by using a stack to store the cells to be processed.\n\nAfter considering these approaches, I would implement the following optimized longest increasing path function:\n\n```\ndef longest_increasing_path(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return 0\n\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    memo = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    def dfs(i, j):\n        if memo[i][j] > 0:\n            return memo[i][j]\n\n        val = matrix[i][j]\n        max_len = 1\n\n        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n            ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n            if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and matrix[ni][nj] > val:\n                max_len = max(max_len, 1 + dfs(ni, nj))\n\n        memo[i][j] = max_len\n        return max_len\n\n    max_len = 0\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            max_len = max(max_len, dfs(i, j))\n\n    return max_len\n```\n\nThis optimized function uses memoization to store the results of subproblems, pruning to reduce the number of cells to be processed, and early termination to stop the DFS as soon as a cell is found that is not part of the longest increasing path. It also uses an optimized DFS algorithm that minimizes the number of recursive calls."}

This is not efficient for large arrays.\n\nTo optimize the code to achieve a time complexity of O(n), we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to keep track of the maximum and minimum product ending at each position. This is because the maximum product can be either the current number itself or the product of the current number and the maximum product ending at the previous position. Similarly, the minimum product can be either the current number itself or the product of the current number and the minimum product ending at the previous position.\n\nHere's the optimized code:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        if not nums:\n            return 0\n\n        max_product = min_product = result = nums[0]\n\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] < 0:\n                max_product, min_product = min_product, max_product\n\n            max_product = max(nums[i], max_product * nums[i])\n            min_product = min(nums[i], min_product * nums[i])\n\n            result = max(result, max_product)\n\n        return result\n```\n\nIn this code, we initialize `max_product`, `min_product`, and `result` with the first element of the array. Then, we iterate over the array starting from the second element. For each element, we update `max_product` and `min_product` based on the current element and the previous `max_product` and `min_product`. We also update `result` with the maximum of `result` and `max_product`. If the current element is negative, we swap `max_product` and `min_product` because a negative number can turn a large product into a small product or vice versa.\n\nThis optimized code has a time complexity of O(n) because it only needs to iterate over the array once."}
