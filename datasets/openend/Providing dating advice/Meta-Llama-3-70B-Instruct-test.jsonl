For example, \"What do you like to do in your free time?\" or \"What's been the highlight of your week?\"\n\n2. **Find common ground**: Morgan can look for shared interests or experiences and use those as conversation starters. For example, \"I saw that you like hiking. What's your favorite hiking spot?\" or \"I'm also a fan of that TV show. What do you think of the latest season?\"\n\n3. **Show genuine interest**: Morgan can show genuine interest in the other person's profile or bio.

For example, \"I feel disappointed and undervalued when you cancel plans at the last minute\" rather than \"You always cancel plans at the last minute and it's really frustrating.\"\n\n3. **Specify the impact**: Jamie should explain how Pat's behavior is affecting them, rather than just stating their feelings. For example, \"When you cancel plans, I feel like I'm not a priority to you, and it makes me question whether we should be making plans at all.\"\n\n4. **Avoid blaming or attacking language**: Phrases like \"You always\" or \"You never\" can come across as accusatory and put Pat on the defensive. Instead, Jamie should focus on their own feelings and experiences.\n\n5. **Listen to Pat's perspective**: Jamie should give Pat a chance to explain themselves and listen to their reasons for cancelling plans. There may be valid reasons or circumstances that Jamie is not aware of.\n\n6. **Seek a solution together**: Jamie and Pat can work together to find a solution that works for both of them. For example, they could discuss ways to give each other more notice when cancelling plans or find alternative activities that can be done on short notice.\n\nHere's an example of how Jamie could communicate their feelings to Pat:\n\n\"Hey Pat, can we talk about something that's been bothering me? I've noticed that you've been cancelling plans at the last minute a lot lately, and it's making me feel really disappointed and undervalued. When you do that, I feel like I'm not a priority to you, and it makes me question whether we should be making plans at all. I understand that things come up, but I wish we could find a way to give each other more notice or have a backup plan. Can we figure something out together?\"\n\nBy following these steps, Jamie can effectively communicate their feelings to Pat without causing conflict and work together to find a solution that strengthens their relationship."}

Instead, they could suggest alternative solutions, such as \"Would it be possible to schedule a weekly call or send each other updates about our daily lives?\"\n\n**Step 4: Show empathy and understanding**\nRiley should acknowledge Casey's busy schedule and express understanding. This can help Casey feel seen and appreciated, making them more receptive to Riley's concerns.
