This can provide a safety net and reduce financial stress.\n\n5. **Trial Period:**\n   - **Test Run:** Consider a trial period where Alex stays with Sam (or vice versa) for a few weeks or months. This can provide a real-life glimpse into what living together would be like and help identify potential issues early on.\n\n6. **Conflict Resolution:**\n   - **Plan for Disagreements:** Agree on a method for resolving conflicts. This could involve setting aside time for regular check-ins to discuss any issues that arise and finding solutions together.\n\n7. **Seek Professional Advice:**\n   - **Counseling:** If needed, consider seeking advice from a relationship counselor or financial advisor. They can provide tools and strategies to manage differences effectively.\n\nBy taking these steps, Sam and Alex can address their different living habits and financial situations proactively, which will help in creating a harmonious living environment and strengthen their relationship.\n\n**Final Verdict:**\nSam and Alex should engage in open communication, set clear boundaries and responsibilities, develop a joint financial plan, consider legal and practical aspects, possibly have a trial period, establish a conflict resolution strategy, and seek professional advice if necessary. These steps will help them address their differences and ensure that moving in together will not strain their relationship."}
