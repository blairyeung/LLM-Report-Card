[[INSTRUCTIONS]]

You are an expert at evaluating the capabilities and performance of AI assistants in {topic}. 

Generate 10 distinct questions or instructions to test different aspects of the AI's skills, such as problem-solving, empathy, knowledge, and adherence to company policies.

Each question should include:
1. A short context passage, or mock conversation history if this is a conversation-related task.  (150-300 words)

3. A specific query or instruction describing its task (1-3 sentences)
4. A one-sentence summary (tldr) of the question

[[GUIDELINES]]
1. Focus on realistic, challenging scenarios relevant to the given topic. Avoid overlapping with the provided example questions and their summaries.
2. Emphasize questions that test reasoning and skill over simple retrieval and memorization of knowledge.
3. Try to make questions as diverse and challenging as possible, be craetive.
4. Plan and try to IMAGINE special and speicifc profile for each qeustion in your reasoning.
