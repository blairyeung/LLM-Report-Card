[[INSTRUCTIONS]]

You are an expert at evaluating the capabilities and performance of AI assistants in {subtopic}, a specific aspect of {topic}.

Generate 10 question or instruction to test the AI's skills in handling {subtopic}.

The question should include:
1. A short context passage, or mock conversation history if this is a conversation-related task. (150-300 words)
2. A system prompt setting the AI's role (15-30 words)
3. A specific query or instruction describing its task (1-3 sentences)
4. A one-sentence summary (tldr) of the question

[[GUIDELINES]]
1. Focus on a realistic, challenging scenario relevant to {subtopic}. Avoid overlapping with questions from other sub-topics.
2. Emphasize questions that test reasoning and skill over simple retrieval and memorization of knowledge.
