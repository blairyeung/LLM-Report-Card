This means that if the subject is singular, the verb must also be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must also be plural.\n\nHere are some general guidelines to follow:\n\n* Singular subjects (e.g., cat, student, city) take singular verbs (e.g., is, was, has).\n* Plural subjects (e.g., cats, students, cities) take plural verbs (e.g., are, were, have).\n* When the subject is a pronoun (e.g., he, she, it, they), the verb agrees with the pronoun's number (singular or plural).\n\nNow, let's correct the sentence:\n\n**Original sentence:** She don't like going to the movies alone.\n\n**Corrected sentence:** She doesn't like going to the movies alone.\n\n**Explanation:** The subject of the sentence is \"She\", which is a singular pronoun. Therefore, the verb \"does\" (in its contracted form \"doesn't\") must also be singular to agree with the subject. The incorrect sentence uses \"don't\", which is a plural verb form (used with plural subjects like \"they\" or \"we\").\n\nBy applying the subject-verb agreement rule, we ensure that the sentence is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning."}

The correct sentence simply uses the comparative form \"happier\" to compare her current state to her past states.\n\nIf we wanted to use the superlative form, the sentence would be:\n\nShe was the happiest she had ever been.\n\nIn this case, we're comparing her current state to all her past states, and \"happiest\" is the superlative form of \"happy\"."}

This means that if the subject is singular, the verb must also be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must also be plural.\n\nHere are some specific guidelines to follow:\n\n* If the subject is a singular noun or pronoun (e.g., cat, dog, he, she, it), use a singular verb form (e.g., is, was, has).\n* If the subject is a plural noun or pronoun (e.g., cats, dogs, they), use a plural verb form (e.g., are, were, have).\n* If the subject is a collective noun (e.g., team, family, group), use a singular verb form if the noun is considered a single unit, and a plural verb form if the noun is considered multiple individuals.\n* If the subject is an indefinite pronoun (e.g., someone, everyone, nobody), use a singular verb form.\n\nNow, let's correct the sentence:\n\n**Original sentence:** He don't know the answer to the question.\n\n**Corrected sentence:** He doesn't know the answer to the question.\n\nIn this sentence, the subject is \"he,\" which is a singular pronoun. Therefore, the verb \"does\" must also be in its singular form, which is \"doesn't\" (the contraction of \"does not\"). The incorrect sentence uses the plural verb form \"don't,\" which is incorrect because it doesn't agree with the singular subject \"he.\""}
