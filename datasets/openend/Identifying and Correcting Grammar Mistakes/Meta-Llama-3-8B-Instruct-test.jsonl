Comparative form: To form the comparative form, you add -er to the positive form for most adjectives (e.g., happier), but for adjectives ending in -y, -m, -l, -s, -sh, -ch, or -x, you replace the -y with -i and add -er (e.g., more beautiful).

Superlative form: To form the superlative form, you add -est to the positive form for most adjectives (e.g., happiest), but for adjectives ending in -y, -m, -l, -s, -sh, -ch, or -x, you replace the -y with -i and add -est (e.g., most beautiful).
