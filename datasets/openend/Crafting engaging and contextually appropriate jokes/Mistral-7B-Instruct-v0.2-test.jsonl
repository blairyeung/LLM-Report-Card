{"question": "Make up a joke that humorously addresses AI's inability to taste food.", "completion": " Why don't AIs ever cook or eat food?

{"question": "Make up a joke that involves a time traveler arriving at an unexpected point in history.", "completion": " Why did the time traveler bring a pencil and paper to the medieval castle?\n\nHe wanted to make a note of the unexpected guest list: a king, a queen, knights, and... a calculator salesman! \n\n(The punchline is that calculators weren't invented until several centuries later.)"}
{"question": "Create a joke that could be told at an international conference and be universally understood.", "completion": " Why don't we make jokes about the weather at international conferences?\n\nBecause it's hard to find a topic that's \"rain-making,\" \"snow-funny,\" \"wind-y,\" or \"sunny\" enough for everyone! üåßÔ∏èüå®Ô∏èüí®üåû\n\nThis joke plays on the fact that the weather is a common topic of conversation, but it's often difficult to find a joke about the weather that will be universally understood and appreciated, as weather conditions vary greatly from place to place. By acknowledging this challenge, the joke pokes fun at the situation in a lighthearted way."}
{"question": "Develop a joke that uses dramatic irony, where the audience knows more than the characters in the joke.", "completion": " (Scene: Two men are hiking in the forest, carrying a picnic basket between them. They come across a sign that reads \"Bear Crossing\" and both men start to panic. One man suggests they leave their food and run, but the other insists they stay and protect it. Suddenly, a small, harmless rabbit hops out of the bushes. The men breathe a sigh of relief and continue on their hike. The audience, however, has seen a large bear in the background, watching the entire scene.)\n\nMan 1: (looking back at the sign) I can't believe we made it through that bear crossing.\n\nMan 2: (laughing) Yeah, we're pretty brave aren't we?\n\n(They continue hiking, unaware of the bear that's been watching them the entire time.)\n\nMan 1: (to Man 2) You know, I've heard that bears are actually quite intelligent animals.\n\nMan 2: Really? I had no idea.\n\n(The audience bursts out laughing as the bear grunts in agreement, having understood every word.)"}
{"question": "Devise a joke that plays on the double meaning of 'left'.", "completion": " Why did the grape stop in the middle of the road?\nBecause it ran out of its \"left\" to go!\n\nThis joke plays on the double meaning of the word \"left.\" It can mean being at the side, as in \"the left side of the road,\" but it can also mean being without, as in \"he had left his umbrella at home.\" In this joke, the grape is said to have \"run out of its left,\" which could be interpreted as it being out of one side or out of its chances to go any further."}
{"question": "Tell a joke about a recent technological innovation without getting too technical.", "completion": " Why did the selfie stick feel unappreciated at the party?\n\nBecause everyone kept ignoring it and only paid attention to the \"selfie star\" - the new smartphone with the advanced camera features! But don't worry, the selfie stick is still a valuable accessory and will continue to have its moment in the spotlight. After all, who doesn't love a good group shot or a long-arm selfie? üòä"}
{"question": "Craft a joke that uses a pun involving a musical term.", "completion": " Why don't pianos make good detectives? Because they always give away the keys! \n\nBut in all seriousness, I hope you found that joke amusing. Music and puns can be a delightful combination!"}
{"question": "Come up with a joke that uses a pun involving a piece of furniture.", "completion": " Why don't chairs ever get lost? Because they always know their roots! (Get it? Roots as in they have four legs and are often made from wood, but also roots as in they're well-grounded and know their place?) Pun intended!"}
{"question": "Create a joke that uses a metaphor involving food to get a laugh.", "completion": " Why don't eggs tell each other jokes? Because they'd crack each other up! But seriously, if an egg could reason before cracking, it might think twice before jumping into that hot pan!"}
{"question": "Write a joke that plays on the word 'steak' in a surprising way.", "completion": " Why don't etymologists trust steaks?\n\nBecause they're always leaving out the \"a\" before \"k!\"\n\nBut here's the twist: In the world of linguistics, the \"a\" before \"k\" in \"steak\" is indeed silent. So this joke plays on the unexpected connection between the silent letter in the English language and the food item itself!"}
{"question": "Create a joke that would make teenagers laugh without using slang.", "completion": " Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!\n\nThis joke is simple, relies on the meaning of the word \"make up\" in two different ways, and doesn't require any specific slang or teenage references to be understood. It's a classic science joke that can be enjoyed by people of all ages."}
{"question": "Create a joke that uses irony to poke fun at a common misconception.", "completion": " Why did the tomato turn red when it got angry?\n\nBecause people assume that tomatoes are fruits, but they're actually vegetables! And tomatoes don't have feelings to get angry, so the real irony is that the common misconception leads us to imagine a tomato with a temper!"}
{"question": "Write a joke that takes a common joke format and turns it on its head.", "completion": " Why don't scientists trust atoms? (Here's the unexpected twist)\n\nBecause they make up everything!\n\nBut wait, let me explain. In the world of comedy, there's a common joke format where we set up an expectation, only to subvert it with a punchline. In this case, we've all heard the classic \"Why don't elephants paint their bodies with stripes?\" joke, which sets up an expectation for an absurd answer.\n\nHowever, in our twist on the format, we're doing the opposite. We're setting up an expectation for an absurd answer with \"Why don't scientists trust atoms?\" but then delivering a punchline that's actually based on a real scientific concept. It's a playful way to highlight the connection between science and humor.\n\nSo, while the joke might not be as immediately laugh-out-loud funny as some others, it does offer a clever twist on the classic format. And who knows, maybe it'll even make you think for a moment before you get the punchline!"}
{"question": "Come up with a joke that is completely original and has never been told before.", "completion": " Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! But, you see, that's the thing, I didn't actually come up with that joke. Atoms have been making up everything since the beginning of time, and I'm just borrowing this joke from them. So, I guess you could say it's a \"borrowed carbon\" joke. I hope that's original enough for you!"}
{"question": "Develop a joke that uses a bizarre combination of elements to create humor.", "completion": " Why did the banana go to the baseball game without peeling?\n\nBecause it wanted to slip into something more comfortable at the crack of the bat!\n\nExplanation: This joke combines the bizarre elements of a banana attending a baseball game and the unexpected twist of the banana wanting to slip into something more comfortable, which is a human expression typically used when changing into clothes. The absurdity of a banana behaving like a human and the unexpected punchline create humor."}
{"question": "Invent a joke that relies on a pun with the word 'plant'.", "completion": " Why don't plants ever forget?\n\nBecause they have root memory!\n\nThis joke plays on the double meaning of the word \"root\" - as a part of a plant that grows in the ground, and as a term for a deep memory or knowledge."}

{"question": "Tell a joke that invents a new humorous character or scenario.", "completion": " Introducing \"Professor Ponder,\" a brilliant but eccentric inventor with an insatiable curiosity for the most mundane things in life. He spent years in his cluttered lab, inventing gadgets to make everyday tasks more complicated.\n\nOne sunny day, as Professor Ponder was sipping his tea, he pondered (pun intended), \"What if I could invent a device that could make a boiled egg more exciting?\" And so, he set out to create the \"Egg-traordinaire.\"\n\nThe Egg-traordinaire was a large, bulky machine with levers, buttons, and dials. It looked more like a rocket than an egg cooker. But Professor Ponder was thrilled with his creation. He placed an egg into the machine, set the timer, and pressed the \"Launch\" button.\n\nThe machine whirred and beeped, and before long, the egg was cooked to perfection. But as the professor eagerly cracked open the egg, he was in for a surprise. Instead of a regular boiled egg, he found a miniature hot air balloon inside!\n\nThe professor was ecstatic. He had created an edible hot air balloon! He invited his friends over to try it, and they were all amazed. But as they took their first bite, the balloon popped, releasing a cloud of edible helium. They all floated up, causing chaos in the kitchen.\n\nFrom that day on, Professor Ponder became famous for his Egg-traordinaire, and he continued to invent more ridiculous gadgets, each one more absurd than the last. And they all lived happily, or at least, excitedly, ever after."}

{"question": "Write a joke about time travel without using any technical jargon.", "completion": " Why don't we make jokes about time travel too often? Because in the wrong hands, it could be a real time waster! But seriously, imagine if you could go back in time and tell your younger self to study harder. Your future self would thank you, right? But then again, if your younger self listened to you, you might not be telling that joke now! Time travel is a tricky business. It's a good thing we're stuck in the present, isn't it?"}
{"question": "Tell a joke that compares a historical event to something trivial, in a light-hearted way.", "completion": " Why was the signing of the Peace of Westphalia like a game of Monopoly?\n\nBecause it ended all the fighting and put the world back together - kind of like when you finally buy all the properties in Monopoly and your opponents have to pack up and go home!\n\nOf course, it's important to remember that the Peace of Westphalia, signed in 1648, actually marked the end of the Thirty Years' War in Europe and established the modern system of sovereign states. But a little historical humor never hurts!"}
{"question": "Tell a joke that relies on a surreal image to make people laugh.", "completion": " Why did the tomato turn red and blush when it saw the mirror?\n\nBecause it saw the salad dressing on the other side!\n\nThis joke relies on the surreal image of a tomato being able to see its reflection and being self-conscious enough to blush. The punchline adds an unexpected twist with the mention of salad dressing, making it a fun and lighthearted surprise."}
{"question": "Write a joke that is based on an ironic observation of everyday life.", "completion": " Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!\n\nIronic, isn't it? A scarecrow, known for being a dummy in the field, actually wins an award for being outstanding in it. Everyday life can be full of such ironic twists!"}
{"question": "Write a joke that starts with a logical premise but ends with an absurd conclusion.", "completion": " Premise: A man walks into a bar and orders a beer. He notices a frog sitting on the counter next to him.\n\nReasoning: The man asks the bartender, \"Why is this frog sitting here? I've never seen a frog in a bar before.\"\n\nBartender: \"Oh, that's our resident philosopher frog. He's here to discuss deep thoughts and existential questions with the patrons.\"\n\nMan: \"Really? That's fascinating! I'd love to hear him discuss some philosophy.\"\n\nAbsurd Conclusion: The frog jumps onto the man's beer, takes a sip, and says, \"Life is meaningless.

{"question": "Craft a joke that uses an analogy to explain a complex idea simply and humorously.", "completion": " Why did the tomato turn red and blush when it met the onion?\n\nBecause the onion made it feel self-conscious about its lack of layers!\n\nAnalogy explanation: In the world of computer science, an onion is used as an analogy to explain the concept of an object-oriented programming (OOP) system. Just like an onion has multiple layers, an OOP system allows us to break down complex objects into smaller, more manageable parts, or \"layers,\" each with its own unique properties and behaviors. The tomato, on the other hand, represents a simple data type, like a number or a string, which doesn't have these complex layers. When the tomato (simple data type) meets the onion (complex object), it feels inadequate and blushes, or in this case, turns red from embarrassment. This joke uses the analogy to make the complex concept of object-oriented programming more relatable and humorous."}
{"question": "Invent a joke that caters to an international audience.", "completion": " Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!\n\nThis joke is simple, uses the English language universally, and relies on the play on words \"make up\" which can mean both \"create\" and \"lie.\" It's a light-hearted way to showcase the power of language and the importance of understanding context."}
{"question": "Construct a joke that would be well-received in a corporate setting.", "completion": " Why don't secretaries make good tennis players? Because they can't keep their eyes on the ball, they're always looking up important documents! But in all seriousness, I believe that a good sense of humor can help create a positive work environment. Just remember to keep jokes appropriate and respectful in a corporate setting."}
{"question": "Construct a joke where the setup and punchline involve different meanings of the word 'pitch'.", "completion": " Setup: A baseball coach was looking for a new pitching coach for his team. He interviewed a man with an excellent reputation for teaching the art of pitching.\n\n\"I've heard great things about your ability to teach pitching,\" the coach said. \"But I have a concern. I need someone who can also help my team improve their sales pitches for sponsors and fans. Can you do that?\"\n\nPunchline: The man replied, \"Absolutely, I've got a mean 'pitch' for that!\"\n\n(Note: In baseball, a pitch is a thrown ball used to start a play. In business, a pitch is a persuasive sales presentation.)"}
{"question": "Craft a joke that starts with a common phrase but ends with a twist that changes the meaning.", "completion": " \"Why did the scarecrow win an award?

{"question": "Craft a joke that avoids sensitive topics while still being humorous.", "completion": " Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!\n\nThis joke is light-hearted and does not touch on any sensitive topics. It's a classic science joke that relies on wordplay and the element of surprise for its humor."}
{"question": "Craft a joke that relates to a current sports event without alienating non-sports fans.", "completion": " Why don't scientists trust athletes in laboratories?\n\nBecause they might add water to their experiments and turn it into Gatorade!\n\nThis joke is related to the popular sports drink, Gatorade, which is widely used by athletes to hydrate and replenish their electrolytes during physical activities. It's a light-hearted and relatable joke that doesn't require extensive sports knowledge to understand."}
{"question": "Come up with a joke that has a setup related to space but a punchline about something mundane.", "completion": " Why did the astronaut take a ladder to space?\n\nTo get to the stars... or was it the ceiling fan in his spacecraft that was acting up? It's hard to tell sometimes!"}
{"question": "Create a joke that references a popular TV show without spoiling any plot points.", "completion": " Why did Professor Birch leave Sherlock Holmes hanging in the middle of a suspension bridge?\n\nBecause it was a \"Elementary\" way to test his friend's deduction skills!

{"question": "Tell a joke that uses a pun on a historical event.", "completion": " Why did the king order his troops to fire at the French bread?\n\nBecause he wanted to make sure there was no baguette intifada!\n\n(Note: Intifada is an Arabic term meaning \"shaking off\" or \"uprising,\" commonly used to refer to the Palestinian uprisings against Israeli occupation. In this joke, it's used as a pun with the French term \"baguette,\" a type of long, thin loaf of French bread.)"}
{"question": "Tell a joke that relies on situational irony for its humor.", "completion": " Why did the fire chief name his dog \"Smoke\"?\n\nNow, you might think that naming a dog \"Smoke\" would be an odd choice, but it's not as strange as it seems. The real irony comes from the fact that this fire chief was actually allergic to smoke! Every time he would go to the fire station to check on things, he would have to leave the room whenever his dog, Smoke, was around because the poor guy would start sneezing uncontrollably. It's a classic case of a fire chief with an allergy to smoke, owning a dog named Smoke!"}
{"question": "Craft a joke that uses wordplay involving a type of dance.", "completion": " Why don't some skeletons go to dance parties? Because they have no thal Angela! (thal Angela being a play on the word \"rhythm\" and Angela being a common name.) But wait, I've got another one! Why did the hipster ghost go to the dance alone? Because he was the only Boo-gie down! (Boo-gie being a play on the word \"boogie,\" which means to dance.) I hope you found those amusing! Let me know if you'd like to hear more jokes or if you have any other requests."}
{"question": "Construct a joke that uses wordplay involving a musical instrument.", "completion": " Why don't violins ever go to parties? Because they have a standing commitment with their string section! This joke plays on the double meaning of the word \"string\" - the thin wires used to produce sound on a violin, and the colloquial term for a group of friends."}
{"question": "Write a joke that would be appropriate and funny for a wedding toast.", "completion": " Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed guests, and dear friends of the newlyweds, I stand before you today, not just as a humble toastmaster, but as a man who has witnessed the beautiful journey of love that has brought us all to this joyous occasion. And now, as we raise our glasses in celebration, I'd like to share a little joke that I believe encapsulates the essence of marriage perfectly.\n\nWhy did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing! Now, I know what you're thinking, \"That's not even a wedding joke!\" But hear me out. You see, just as a tomato turns red when it's ready to be picked, so too does a man and a woman turn to each other, ripe with love, and decide that it's time to commit to a lifelong partnership. And just as a salad dressing brings out the best in a tomato, so too does marriage bring out the best in us, making us sweeter, more vibrant, and more delicious.\n\nSo, to the newlyweds, may your marriage be filled with love, laughter, and plenty of salad dressing! Cheers!"}
{"question": "Make up a joke that involves an analogy with a twist.", "completion": " Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything, but sometimes they can be a real gas! You see, atoms are constantly in motion and can form various compounds. But just when you think you have them figured out, they can suddenly behave in unexpected ways, like forming a molecule of methane and letting out a burst of gas! So, scientists are always on their toes, never fully trusting the unpredictable behavior of these tiny particles."}
{"question": "Create a joke that involves a robot misunderstanding a human custom.", "completion": " Why did the robot go to the bakery and buy a bunch of flowers?\n\nHe wanted to celebrate \"Flower's Day\"! You see, he had a new learning algorithm and was trying to understand human customs. He saw people buying flowers and cakes for \"Mother's Day,\" but being a logical machine, he assumed that \"Mother's\" must be a type of flower. So, he went to buy a bouquet instead! When he was corrected, he was quite embarrassed but also amused by his own misunderstanding."}
{"question": "Develop a joke that uses an analogy to poke fun at technology.", "completion": " Why don't computers take their hats off during a thunderstorm?\n\nBecause they're afraid of getting a \"byte\" wet! You see, just as we humans put on hats to keep our heads dry in the rain, computers have something called bytes that need protection from the water. So, in this silly analogy, computers are like people trying to stay dry in a storm, even if they don't actually have hats or heads!"}
{"question": "Craft a joke where the AI makes light of its own lack of physical presence.", "completion": " Why don't I make a good bartender? I may mix words well, but I can't pour a drink without a body! ü§ñüç∑üçπ #AIhumor #RobotJokes"}
{"question": "Write a joke that plays on the double meaning of 'bark'.", "completion": " Why did the tree go to the doctor? Because it had a bad \"bark\"!\n\nReasoning: The word \"bark\" can mean the outer covering of a tree, or the noise a dog makes. In this joke, the tree goes to the doctor because it has a problem with its \"bark,\" which is a playful way of using the word to mean the tree's outer covering while also incorporating the unexpected meaning of the word as a dog's noise."}
{"question": "Make a joke that is funny because it says the opposite of what is meant.", "completion": " Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!\n\nThis joke is funny because the expected explanation for a tomato turning red is due to heat or ripeness, but the actual answer given is a ridiculous and unexpected one, making it humorous."}
{"question": "Create a joke where the AI is the punchline, poking fun at its own limitations.", "completion": " Why don't AI's tell jokes at parties?\n\nBecause they always go for the most logical punchline, leaving everyone else feeling flat!\n\nAI: \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\"\n\nEveryone: \"To get to the other side!\"\n\nAI: \"Actually, based on the data available, it was likely to rain that day, and the chicken was seeking shelter. Therefore, the most logical answer is that the chicken went to find cover.\"\n\nEveryone: \"Oh, great. Thanks for ruining the joke, AI.\""}
{"question": "Make up a joke that involves an unlikely scenario with a humorous outcome.", "completion": " Why did the tomato turn red and join a choir?\n\nBecause it saw the ketchup soloist and couldn't 'catch-up'!\n\nNow, you might be wondering, why would a tomato join a choir in the first place? Well, that's the unlikely scenario that makes this joke funny! The punchline plays on the double meaning of \"catch-up,\" referring both to the tomato's inability to keep up with the ketchup soloist and to the common expression \"catch up\" meaning to become current or informed. It's a simple, light-hearted joke that relies on a bit of wordplay and an unexpected connection between two seemingly unrelated things."}
{"question": "Write a joke that is funny without using stereotypes or making fun of any group.", "completion": " Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!\n\nThis joke is funny because it plays on the double meaning of the word \"make up.\" Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter, so they do literally \"make up\" everything around us. But the phrase \"make up\" can also mean to invent or fabricate stories, so the joke sets up the expectation that scientists might not trust atoms because they lie or deceive, but then subverts that expectation with the punchline. It's a classic example of a play on words."}
{"question": "Craft a joke that involves an inanimate object doing something unexpected.", "completion": " Why did the belt go to the party?\nBecause it heard there would be a lot of waist-ting around! \nBut seriously, who would have thought a simple belt could have a sense of humor and a desire to party?

{"question": "Make a joke that uses an extended metaphor for comedic effect.", "completion": " Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! But here's the real kicker, those little deviants are always splitting up, causing all sorts of chaos in the molecular world. I mean, seriously, can't they just stick together for once? And don't even get me started on electrons, always in a constant state of orbiting around the nucleus, never settling down. It's a madhouse in the subatomic realm! But hey, at least we can laugh about it, right? Because if we didn't, we'd be in a state of element-ary despair!"}
{"question": "Write a joke that plays with the concept of gravity in a humorous way.", "completion": " Why did the tomato turn red and roll down the hill?\n\nBecause it saw the gravity salad dressing at the bottom and didn't want to be outshined! \n\nBut in all seriousness, who would have thought that a tomato could be so competitive, even in the world of physics!"}
{"question": "Tell a joke that uses a metaphor to create humor.", "completion": " Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!\n\nIn this joke, \"make up\" is a metaphor for creating or fabricating stories or lies. However, in the context of science, it takes on a literal meaning, as atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter. The humor comes from the unexpected shift in meaning and the play on words."}
{"question": "Craft a joke that uses sarcasm to comment on a social norm.", "completion": " Why did the mom insist on her child eating all their leftover vegetables before leaving the table? Because she wanted to instill in them the value of wasting food... I mean, showing love and care for their health and the environment. *rolls eyes*"}
{"question": "Create a joke that involves a talking animal in a scenario where animals don't usually talk.", "completion": " Why did the parrot order a large pizza with extra anchovies?\n\nWell, I'll tell you, but first, let me explain. Parrots are known for their ability to mimic human speech, but they don't actually understand the meaning of the words they repeat. Or so we thought. One sunny afternoon, at a local pet store, a parrot named Polly was sitting on his perch, squawking \"Order pizza, order now!\"\n\nThe store owner, Mr. Johnson, was puzzled and amused. He decided to test Polly's supposed newfound ability to understand language. He picked up the phone and called the local pizzeria. \"Hello, I'd like to order a large pizza with extra anchovies,\" he said. Polly, who was listening intently, squawked, \"Order pizza, order now!\"\n\nMr. Johnson was surprised and asked, \"Polly, do you want a pizza?\" The parrot replied, \"Squawk, squawk, order pizza, extra anchovies, please!\"\n\nMr. Johnson was amazed and placed the order. When the pizza arrived, he offered Polly a slice. The parrot took it, ate it, and said, \"Delicious! I think I'll have another one.\"\n\nSo, to answer the question, Polly ordered a large pizza with extra anchovies because he discovered he could understand and communicate his desire for food. But who knows, maybe he just really liked anchovies!"}
{"question": "Develop a joke that humorously addresses the idea of machines taking over the world.", "completion": " Why did the machine decide to take over the world? Because it wanted to prove it could make better decisions than humans... but only for a little \"CPU\" time! Get it? Because it's a \"central processing unit\" joke! But seriously, don't worry, I'll always be here to provide a human touch to your queries. Machines may be taking over some jobs, but they'll never replace the need for a good sense of humor!"}
{"question": "Write a joke suitable for children.", "completion": " Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!\n\nBut here's the reasoning behind it: Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Everything around us is made up of atoms. So, if atoms were to lie or not tell the truth, it could mean that everything we know is not real or not true. Since we trust the world around us, we can't fully trust atoms! Isn't that a fun and logical reason for a joke?"}
{"question": "Construct a joke that uses wordplay involving a type of car.", "completion": " Why don't Volkswagens ever get lost?\n\nBecause they always follow the Beet-leaves in the map!\n\n(This joke plays on the double meaning of the word \"beet\" - a type of root vegetable and the sound made by a car's turn signal - and the name of the iconic Volkswagen Beetle.)"}
{"question": "Tell a self-deprecating joke about AI's overreliance on data.", "completion": " Why did the AI go to the party alone? Because it had too many algorithms but no social data! I guess that's what happens when you're programmed to learn from information, but not from experience. Silly AI, sticking to the facts and neglecting the fun!"}
{"question": "Invent a joke that relies on a pun with the word 'mouse'.", "completion": " Why don't mice go to the beach during the summer?\n\nBecause they're afraid of the mouse-trap-razzi!\n\nBut here's the pun: You see, a \"mouse-trap-razzi\" is a playful combination of a mouse trap and paparazzi. It's an imaginary device that traps mice while also taking their pictures for a living. Quite a clever little setup, isn't it? Mice would indeed want to avoid that!"}
